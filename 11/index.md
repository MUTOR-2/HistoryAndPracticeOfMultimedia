# Introduction

This talk is going to give a brief introduction to my thinking about instrument and interaction design as an artistic practice, focusing on human-object relationships and the social contexts that frame these interactions.

We will wind our way through a forest of various points of interest, traveling towards what I think of as an ecological approach to media performance.

As a framework for thinking through these ideas, I am drawing on my own artistic practice and the research that went into a course called “Situated Instrument Design” that I developed some years ago at UC Berkeley’s Center for New Music and Audio Technologies (or CNMAT).

{% include img-figure width="600px" url="assets/images/unit11/CNMAT.png"  description="David Wessel (top left), Adrian Freed (top right), UC Berkeley’s Center for New Music and Audio Technologies (CNMAT)" %}

The class was centered on the instrumental system design research of David Wessel and Adrian Freed at CNMAT, and the ideas that flowed from their innovative work in the theory and practice of human computer interaction and realtime electronic sound, based on David Wessel’s background in cognitive science and free improvisation.

Like Wessel, my own background in music came largely through the practice of improvisation, and in many ways I think of composition, and process of developing instrument systems, as different modes of instrumental practice. 

And this experience of instrumental performance, forming close relationships objects, has proven to be a key element in developing a holistic and open-ended framework of what the idea of “instrument” means, or could mean.

# Instruments, tools, things

Ok, so… what is an instrument exactly? 

Is it a:  
>mechanism? 

>utensil? 

>appliance?

>equipment?

>device?

>contraption?

>contrivance?

>gadget?

>gizmo?

>a form of labor-saving technology?

The Oxford Dictionary defines an instrument as:

*instrument*
: A tool or implement, especially one for precision work.
: A means of pursing an aim.
: sA person who is exploited or made use of.
: A measuring device used to gauge the level, position, speed, etc. of something, especially a motor vehicle or aircraft.
: An object or device for producing musical sounds. (also musical instrument)
: A form or legal document. {% include cite ref="lexico" %}


So, I think interesting here is that music is not the first meaning. Of course it depends on the dictionary, don’t forget that dictionaries are also editorial instruments that express the curated ideas of the people who put the dictionary together! I actually made a piece about this once a long time ago.

Also interesting is that none of the definitions really seem complete; they are all somewhat circular, referring to other synonyms that were in our list. We learn that an instrument is a type of tool. Ok. But, let’s see if we can follow the path of definitions until we find something general enough to think about multimedia.

When we look up the word *tool* we learn that a tool is:

*tool*
: A device or implement, especially one held in the hand, used to carry out a particular function. {% include cite ref="lexico" %}

And then if we then look up device we see that a *device* is:

*device*
: A thing made or adapted for a particular purpose, especially a piece of mechanical or electronic equipment. {% include cite ref="lexico" %}

A device is also listed as being a bomb or other explosive weapon, so we can learn something about our human editors here.

So here we have *thing*. A thing is a useful idea, and seems to give us a lot of leeway to define as we see fit for a given situation. Since we are talking about instruments in the artistic/multimedia context, we want our definition to have room to consider an instrument in as many ways as possible.

If we go a bit further, we find the definition of *thing* is: 

*thing*
: An object that one need not, cannot, or does not wish to give a specific name to.
: An inanimate material object as distinct from a living sentient being.
: An action, event, thought, or utterance. {% include cite ref="lexico" %}

I love this first definition! “An object that one need not, cannot, or does not wish to give a specific name to.” So, a *thing* is an *object*. Beyond that, the dictionary can’t give it a name. But you may wish to if you feel the need. And here we can see aesthetic choice starting to enter the picture.

Turning to the definition of object, we reach a point of recursion; an *object* is also a *thing*.

An *object* is defined as:

*object*
: A material thing that can be seen and touched.
>A thing external to the thinking mind or subject.
: A person or thing to which a specified action or feeling is directed.
>A goal or purpose {% include cite ref="lexico" %}

This dictionary dive is not just an etymological exercise, these meanings can really have a direct and tangible influence in the way we create and use things in making art.

{% include img-figure width="400px" url="assets/images/unit11/stiller.png"  description="Fischli and Weiss, “Stiller nachmittag” (1985)" %}

So, the *thing-object* seems to imply something (anything) that is not us—the subjective sensing person. This definition of *thing* also mentions the sense of an external *otherness*, which is a deep part of the way we situate ourselves in our environments. But of course from the other peoples’ prospectives we are ourselves also some kind of otherness, so I think really everything is a *thing*.

We are constantly seeing, feeling, sensing the world, which is made of things. When these things are “a tool or implement, especially one for precision work”, then we might typically call them, *instruments*. And we have learned to do all sorts of different *things* by interacting with objects. We are *doing-things* with *things*!

# Embodiment with things

Historian and environmental philosopher Melanie Challenger, writes in her recent book, *How to Be Animal: A New History of What it Means to Be Human (2021)*:

>>>"Life on our planet can be arranged, more or less, into autotrophs and heterotrophs, organisms that exploit energy from the sun or chemical reactions, and organisms that take energy from those who've already captured it. What is unusual about our species is that we've been able to use more and more energy without having to evolve into a different species. We've achieved this through a combination of social learning, complex culture, and technologies. We don't have to speciate to gain the claws of an allosaurus; we can share information to design a warhead or a power station. In other words, we change our tools rather than our bodies." {% include cite ref="challenger" %}(p.15)

So in other words, we have evolved through social learning and culture to develop new tools, devices, objects that allow us new capabilities for action and utility. The tools become extensions of ourselves. As Marshal McLuhan writes:

>>>"During the mechanical ages we had extended our bodies in space. Today, after more than a century of electric technology, we have extended our central nervous system itself in a global embrace, […]" {% include cite ref="mcluhan" %}

Artists know this very well, as we must think, imagine, feel and create *forms*, through the mediation of tools. We call performing musicians *instrumentalists*, who spend much of their lives devoted to the nuanced control of one particular type of instrument. Each art form has its own set of instruments; paintbrushes, knifes, glue, and so I think we can also include every artist as an instrumentalist.

For some artists like dancers and vocalists, the body is the instrument, or for other media like works of relational and participatory art, the conceptual framing of the situation and social context might be created through the instrument of language or architecture.

Each instrument can become a kind of lifestyle—we tend to identify with our instruments in intimate way. They are symbolic of different modes of expression, influencing our perspectives on articulation, and like language, mediate our thinking about of how different kinds of actions might fit into different social situations. 

Our bodies also physically change as a result of this close relationship with our tools. String players develop calluses on their finger tips from the pressure of the strings against the flesh. Violinists and Violists will often have a little red mark on their chin, and so on.

{% include img-figure width="230px" url="assets/images/unit11/hand.png"  description="Hillary Hahn tweet" %}

I broke my arm once skiing, and had the cast slightly angled so that I could continue playing guitar while it was healing. Luckily there was no lasting damage from this, but in some cases instrument technique itself can cause lasting damage, for example for brass players this can be a problem. 

Some instrumentalists will do extreme exercises thought to improve technique—Robert Schumann famously ruined his career as a pianist by using extreme finger stretching technologies of his day.

{% include img-figure width="400px" url="assets/images/unit11/stretcher.png"  description="Hand stretcher for pianists, to increase flexibility" %}

This intensity of the artist’s relationship to their tools is a byproduct of the intensity of the potential throughput in this incorporation of tools with our physical gestures. 

So this is deep *incorporation*—stemming from the Latin *in corpus*; into the body. When we reach a level of fluency with a tool, we don’t think about it anymore, it becomes part of us. We know what will happen when we move in a certain way without it being a conscious decision. 

Action through an instrument becomes instinctual. 

{% include youtube-figure id="UOMI1JKfWwc" 
description="Picasso painting" %}

In the 1980s there was a famous study by Benjamin Libet, who through a series of EEG experiments showed that the brain “registers” the impulse to perform a movement before activity in the conscious decision region of the brain is present. {% include cite ref="taylor" %}
 Although it was later contested, this study was used by some theorists as proof that there is no such thing as free-will, since the body acts before the mind has time to understand. 

We can also recognize that this reaction on instinct is an important part of instrumental performance practice, which aims to internalize the the nuances of action to perform through the mediation of the tool.

{% include img-figure width="500px" url="assets/images/unit11/pollock.png"  description="Jackson Pollock painting (credit unknown)" %}

This expansion of intention through objects could potentially be traced back to the practices we developed as hunter-gathers. In her book, Challenger, writes about studies of the South African San people, one of the last remaining hunter-gather societies:

>>>“What began to fascinate anthropologists who studied the San was their meticulous imitations of the animals they hunt. The hunters, in some sense, become animals in order to make inferences about how their prey might behave. This spills over into ritual. The San use hyperventilation and rhythmic movement to create states of altered consciousness as part of a shamanistic culture. In the final stages of a trance, Lewis-Williams writes, ‘people sometimes feel themselves to be turning into animals and undergoing other frightening or exalting transformations.’ For anthropologist Kim Hill, identifying and observing animals to eat and those to escape might merge into ‘a single process’ that sees animals as having humanlike intentions that ‘can influence and be influenced’. […] [H]umans are also mindshifters. Not only can we see other things in a single image, we can also see other minds in other things.” {% include cite ref="challenger" %}

{% include img-figure width="500px" url="assets/images/unit11/hunters.png"  description="San hunters stalking prey using bows and poisoned arrows ©Christian Boix" %}

So, the tools we use are an extension of ourselves, and evolved with us through social practice, developed over a million years. I would speculate that our relationship with *things*, is based on our social understanding that other things can be *entities* with their own agencies. Like relating to other people, relating to other *things* may also require some psychological ability to read the thoughts and agency of other nonhuman things.

For example, in this description of hunter-gatherer shamanic practices, the hunter-artist performs a transformation into the prey or predator, using their body and psychological energies as an instrument to help them to foresee the actions of the other animal through being them in some way.

# Embodied learning, affordances and constraints

As we learn to influence and perform with a tool or object or entity, we are learning to understand its unique agency and character; how it responds when we interact in one way versus another.

In human-computer interaction (HCI), these are often referred to as the *affordances* and *constraints* of the system, which describe the ways certain types of actions are encouraged or discouraged by its design. {% include cite ref="gibson" %}
 
{% include img-figure width="400px" url="assets/images/unit11/embodied.png"  description="" %}

Based on the *embodied mind* perspective developed by Fransisco Varela and others, David Wessel refers to this process of instrumental learning as an *enactive* process which “emphasizes the role of *sensory-motor* engagement in musical experience,” towards the formation of a “human-instrument symbiosis.” Wessel goes on to discuss the process of learning through the action of *babblin*g, named for the critical role of exploratory vocal experimentation in the development of speech in infants, as they learn to connect sounds with the physical process of production the sound. {% include cite ref="wessel_2006" %} 

One of my other mentors in instrument design was the late Joel Chadabe, who expressed a similar contextual perspective of learning through action, which he likened to “sailing on a stormy sea”, where the sailors have to adapt and learn how to balance and maybe even steer the ship as the waves and winds toss and turn around them.

{% include img-figure width="400px" url="assets/images/unit11/joel.png"  description="Joel Chadabe" %}

This is a bottom-up approach, where knowledge is developed first through action, versus a top-down perspective where plans and ideas are constructed and then executed.

{% include img-figure width="400px" url="assets/images/unit11/improvising.png"  description="Roland Kirk's Album 'Introducing Roland Kirk'" %}

Improvising musicians are good examples of practitioners who are deeply involved with the generation of material from the human-object relationship. Derek Bailey writes:

>>>“Although some improvisors imply a high level of technical skill in their playing, to speak of ‘mastering’ the instrument in improvisation is misleading. The instrument is not just a tool but an ally. It is not only a means to an end, it is a source of material, and technique for the improvisor is often an exploitation of the natural resources of the instrument.” {% include cite ref="bailey" %} 

Let’s keep thinking through the history of this idea of instrumental agency.

In his book *A Million Years of Music* (2015), Musicologist Gary Tomlinson discusses some of the current theories of the social and cognitive context surrounding one of the oldest known tools of the Paleolithic era, the Acheulean biface.

The remarkable symmetries formed in these human shaped rocks, seem to imply a high level of planning to achieve this level of ornate detail. However, archeologies have determined that rather, these tools pre-date our modern conception of planning, and “thinking-at-a-distance.” 

{% include img-figure width="400px" url="assets/images/unit11/acheulean.png"  description="Acheulean biface (Beyene, et al. 2015 )" %}

Tomlinson writes:

>>>"Preconceptual action sequences are structured according to these material affordances, the energy required in working them, and the biomechanical limitations of the worker; and all these together can be enough to engender systematic patterns tending to produce material symmetries. From this vantage, thinking of the hominin mind dictating symmetries has it backwards; it is the body-stone interaction from which symmetries (and perhaps even the mind) emerge. The variability of raw materials, more than varied conceptual plans, will lead to variability in tools produced as well as varied embodied thought.

>>>There is a rich and provocative opportunity glimpsed here of reversing our habits in conceiving early hominin experience. It is not that stone tools are proxies of mind but something closer to the reverse: mind as an outgrowth of the body-stone interface."  {% include cite ref="tomlinson" %} 

And so here we confront a powerful idea: our conceptual development, which has driven humans’ evolution of tools as extensions and modes of expression, was possibly the result of an enactive performance practice, rather than a sudden flash of cognitive advancement.

Tomlinson continues:

>>>“Such performative sociality requires little thinking-at-a-distance. It is closely related to conceptions of embodied cognition that resist the Cartesian separation of thought from matter and emphasize the situatedness of cognition in material matrices extending out from the body.” {% include cite ref="tomlinson" %}

So, as we move, exploring the material matrix that connects our bodies with our tools and environments, we are feeling our way through, and learning by trial and evaluation of the material, and forming a cognitive system, moving from the details toward higher level “thinking-at-a-distance.”

And so, when we perform with an instrument, we are in a way creating a new symbiotic body “material matrix”—a relational network, binding together an assemblage of objects and entities. Each element has its own character, ways of moving, affordances and constraints, and their own layers of agency in the process.
