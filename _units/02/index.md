short_description: Unit on the history of digital art since the invention of the digital computer
summary: "While the groundwork for computer music and multimedia as we practice it today had been laid during the first part of the 20th century, the development of the digital computer during the middle of the previous century was a catalyst of gargantuan impact. Yet the beginnings of digital art were modest as artists had a vision but didn't really know how to teach a computer to accomplish what they were after. The post-war \"tabula rasa\" period in Europe and the United States was one of experimentation and speculation not just in digital art and much of what was produced was informed by the budding fields of information and communication theory. Yet in 1965 John R. Pierce expressed his frustration with the digital computer: \"As a musical instrument, the computer has unlimited potentialities for uttering sound. It can, in fact, produce strings of numbers representing any conceivable or hearable sound... Wonderful things would come out of that box if only we knew how to evoke them.\" This chimed in a new phase in the exploration of the digital computer for art making. In the early 1970s, the first computer music centers were established as platforms for interdisciplinary research where composers, engineers, scholars and scientists were invited to collaborate. With personal computers being slow and costly, those centers remained major attractors for the technically minded composers and the artistically minded technologists, until the advent of broadband Internet and the development of cheap and extraordinarily efficient CPUs led to a paradigm shift around the turn of the millennium. The systematic exploration of the affordances of the computer gave way to a more intuitive and interactive manipulation of digital interfaces both for the acquisition of knowledge and the production of art. The postdigital era was born."

# Introduction

Three phases since 1950:
Speculative phase (1950-1970)
Exploratory phase (1970-2000)
Interactive (post-digital) phase (since 2000)

# SPECULATIVE PHASE

### Information Theory
Popular approach in the 1950s to determine the information content of media. Its strict application to music is hardly comprehensible today.
https://elearning.hfmt-hamburg.de/pluginfile.php/7166/mod_page/content/1/Hiller.png?time=1588358838687
Measurement of information content of music according to Lejaren Hiller


Serial music - Total Serialism
Composition technique going back to Anton Webern, explored by Olivier Messiaen in his pieces "Mode de valeurs et d'intensités" (1949-50) and Cantéyodjayâ (1949) and brought to perfection by the young composers born on the 1920s (Stockhausen, Nono, Boulez). All musical parameters are subjected to the same principles of order.

The first purely electronic compositions: Karlheinz Stockhausen
Born in 1928 near Cologne. One of the most important (the most important?) German composers of the post-war generation. Contributions to all musical genres: acoustic music, electronics, mixed forms. Early on, at the suggestion of Werner Meyer-Eppler https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Meyer-Eppler, occupied himself with information theory.

Major works of the 50s:

Elektronische Studie II (1954, one of the first purely electronic compositions)
Gesang der Jünglinge (1956, first combination of electronic sounds with sampled sound; http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/gesang-der-juenglinge/audio/1/)
Kontakte (1960, mixed media: electronic sounds combined with acoustic instruments)

Elektronische Studie II
The first computer-generated scores
1956: The first composition was the popular music song Push-button Bertha by Martin Klein and Douglas Bolitho.

1960s: 
ST/n compositions by Iannis Xenakis
ST/4 for string quartet; ST/48 for large orchestra

Major theoretical work: Formalised Music: Thought and Mathematics in Composition (1971).
Project 1 (1964) and Project 2 (1966) by Gottfried Michael Koenig (Institute of Sonology, University of Utrecht). Algorithmic composition.


##Hermann Scherchen and the Gravesano Studio
Famous conductor and pianist Hermann Scherchen founded one of the first centers for research in music in Gravesano, Switzerland. He also edited a journal called Gravesaner Blätter (https://elearning.hfmt-hamburg.de/pluginfile.php/8578/mod_page/content/2/00-Inhalt.pdf) which the some of the great minds of his time such as Xenakis and Meyer-Eppler have contributed to.  

Max Mathews: The first computer-generated sounds
https://5mag.net/features/max-mathews-inventor-digital-music/

https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/08/the-first-computer-musician/

“Computer performance of music was born in 1957 when an IBM 704 in NYC played a 17 second composition on the Music I program which I wrote. The timbres and notes were not inspiring, but the technical breakthrough is still reverberating. Music I led me to Music II through V.  A host of others wrote Music 10, Music 360, Music 15, Csound and Cmix. Many exciting pieces are now performed digitally. The IBM 704 and its siblings were strictly studio machines--they were far too slow to synthesize music in real-time. Chowning's FM algorithms and the advent of fast, inexpensive, digital chips made real-time possible, and equally important, made it affordable”. from: Horizons in Computer Music," March 8-9, 1997, Indiana University.

This 1968 short shows some of the ways that Bell Laboratories scientists used computers in communications research. Contains sequences of computer-generated movies, photographs, music and speech. The entire score and main title and credits of the film were produced on a computer - which seems like nothing today, as every film and video in modern production makes its way through a machine - but at the time this was radically early for computer graphics and music. 

Bell Labs was responsible for a few computer graphics and music firsts: 

1961: computer performs "Daisy Bell" with music programmed by Max Mathews and speech programmed by John Kelly and Carol Lockbaum. This was later the inspiration for the computer "HAL" singing the song in the movie 2001. Daisy Bell was also the nickname of one of Alexander Graham Bell's daughters. 

1962: The first digital computer art was created at Bell Labs by A. Michael Noll. 

1963: The first computer animated film was produced by Edward Zajac at Bell Labs. 

1963: The first computer animation language, BEFLIX, was created by Ken Knowlton. 

1966: first ASCII art was created by Ken Knowlton. 

These scientist/artists worked on IBM 704 and 7094 computers:

IBM 704 The computer these artists and scientists originally worked on in the 1960s had 192K of RAM, 6mb of memory on tape, cost $200 an hour to use and filled a whole room. 

IBM 7094 The earliest computer-generated films, created using an IBM 7094 computer and Stromberg-Carlson 4020 microfilm recorder, cost approximately $500 per minute of output. The 709-series computers were transistorized, and a typical 7094 sold for $3,134,500 in the 1960s. 

This film won the CINE Golden Eagle and is in the permanent collection at the Museum of Modern Art in NYC.  


John Cage
1952 Williams Mix

Cage's first composition for tape already pushes the limits of the medium:

»This is a score (192 pages) for making music on magnetic tape. Each page has two systems comprising eight lines each. These eight lines are eight tracks of tape and they are pictured full-size so that the score constitutes a pattern for the cutting of tape and its splicing. All recorded sounds are placed in six categories ... Approximately 600 recordings are necessary to make a version of this piece. The composing means were chance operations dervied from the I-Ching.«

The only realization of this score so far is by Cage himself. Despite the support of Earl Brown and David Tudor in cutting and gluing the tapes, it took about a year to complete the complex sound montage, which is only four minutes long. The performance is performed with four stereo tape recorders and eight loudspeakers.

1969:  

“HPSCHD, by John Cage and Lejaren Hiller, is arguably the wildest composition of the 20th century. Big, brash, exuberant, raucous, a performance is about four hours of ongoing high-level intensity. The sound is a mixture of seven amplified harpsichords playing computer-generated variations of Mozart and other composers along with 51 computer-generated tapes playing what could be off-tuned trumpets sounding some musical charge. The thousands of swirling images, overlayed and mixed, of abstract shapes and colors and of space imagery from slides and films borrowed from NASA, create a chaotic riot of shifting form and color. The audience walks through the performance space, between the harpsichord players, around the loudspeakers. This recording is an event. First, because the quality of the superb sound captures the colors, the details, the exuberance of a performance. Second, because the graphic materials that are included with the recording, fifteen cards that can be assembled into a poster, are so vivid and stunning. More, the notes by Johanne Rivest, Bill Brooks, David Eisenman, Joel Chadabe, and Robert Conant give you the history of the composition, convey the spirit of the first performance, and provide a background for this recording.” CD-Hefttext

# EXPLORATORY PHASE
John Pierce expressed frustration with the computer in 1965 in his article "Portrait of the Computer as a Young Artist":
"As a musical instrument, the computer has unlimited potentialities for uttering sound. It can, in fact, produce strings of numbers representing any conceivable or hearable sound... 
Wonderful things would come out of that box if only we knew how to evoke them."

Around the same time, the contemporary music world also felt disillusioned by serial and post-serial music (Theodor W. Adorno: Difficulties (1966))
