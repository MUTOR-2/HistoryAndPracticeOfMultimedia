short_description: Unit on the history of digital art since the invention of the digital computer
summary: While the groundwork for computer music and multimedia as we practice it today had been laid during the first part of the 20th century, the development of the digital computer during the middle of the previous century was a catalyst of gargantuan impact. Yet the beginnings of digital art were modest as artists had a vision but didn't really know how to teach a computer to accomplish what they were after. The post-war "tabula rasa" period in Europe and the United States was one of experimentation and speculation not just in digital art and much of what was produced was informed by the budding fields of information and communication theory. Yet in 1965 John R. Pierce expressed his frustration with the digital computer: "As a musical instrument, the computer has unlimited potentialities for uttering sound. It can, in fact, produce strings of numbers representing any conceivable or hearable sound... Wonderful things would come out of that box if only we knew how to evoke them." This chimed in a new phase in the exploration of the digital computer for art making. In the early 1970s, the first computer music centers were established as platforms for interdisciplinary research where composers, engineers, scholars and scientists were invited to collaborate. With personal computers being slow and costly, those centers remained major attractors for the technically minded composers and the artistically minded technologists, until the advent of broadband Internet and the development of cheap and extraordinarily efficient CPUs led to a paradigm shift around the turn of the millennium. The systematic exploration of the affordances of the computer gave way to a more intuitive and interactive manipulation of digital interfaces both for the acquisition of knowledge and the production of art. The postdigital era was born.

# Introduction


Three phases since 1950:
Speculative phase (1950-1970)
Exploratory phase (1970-2000)
Interactive (post-digital) phase (since 2000)

# SPECULATIVE PHASE
