short_description: 
summary: "Sound as Things in Space: Some Thoughts on 3D Audio.** We imagine sound as things, as bounded and tangible physical objects in three-dimensional space. “3D” is the way we perceive sound. And spatial language as a manifestation of spatial cognition is not just common in the description of spatial position and movement of auditory, visual or audiovisual objects, but also in the metaphorical description of pitch, timbre and intensity: A sound can be big or small, thick or thin, it can be edgy, sharp, flat or round, a tone can be high or low, a melody rising or falling. Can a listener distinguish between these metaphorical and physical/tangible properties of a sound? And how are spatial positions and trajectories of sound, spatial cognition and emotional impact related? The interdependencies between physical and metaphorical space become specifically interesting in “3D” audio systems like VR audio, Ambisonics or multichannel sound, where position and movement in space become creative devices."

# Introduction Perceiving the Physical Environment

In spatial perception of the sonic environment we might distinguish
between explicit and implicit space: Space is perceived
*explicitly*, as auditory objects span a three-dimensional space
through the perceived distances and directions of the auditory
objects, and *implicitly* through reflections from room boundaries
or non-sounding objects, creating the sensation of being immersed in
space even in the absence of surrounding auditory objects. The
former may be described as “sonic envelopment” or “surroundedness”,
the latter as “room envelopment” {% include cite ref="berg" %}. The
first wavefront arriving at the listener's ears creates the
perception of an auditory object in the position in space from where
this wavefront arrives, while all later instances of the same
soundwave, arriving from random directions, create the perception of
“auditory space” or “room envelopment” (law of the first wavefront
or *precedence effect*). The first wavefront not just defines the
spatial position of the perceived source, but rather its complete
sonic qualities (*generalized precedence effect*, {% include cite
ref="benade" %}).

Fahlenbrach notes: 

> Perceived space is basically different from “physical space”. We
> are not “measuring” physical properties of space, but perceive the
> environment with regard to our options of behaviour in or
> interaction with the environment. Specifically meaningful are
> e.g. sizes of objects and their relations and distances.” 
{% include cite ref="fahlenbrach" %}

The human auditory perceptual system is optimized for orientation in
the horizontal plane. Consequently, perceived space is largely
composed of horizontal spatial cues, namely interaural time
differences (ITD), interaural level differences (ILD) and interaural
spectral differences caused by the acoustical effects of head,
pinnae (external ears) and torso. In contrast, spatial orientation
in the vertical plane is solely determined by the acoustical impact
of pinnae and torso.

The perceptual dominance of the horizontal plane becomes apparent in
“2D” technologies for spatial audio recording and reproduction,
namely stereophonic, quadraphonic, octophonic or surround systems.

# Spatial Illusions Through Recorded Sound

Explicit and implicit spaces refer to perceiving the auditory scene
“as it is”, the apparent physical world. This is different with
recorded or synthesized (acousmatic) sound – Blesser and Salter
note: 

> When music is reproduced electronically, a listener actually
> experiences a hybrid comprising at least three sets of spatial
> attributes: the acoustics of the performance space where the music
> was recorded (recording studio or concert hall), the acoustics
> added during the mixing process when the music was prepared
> (spatial synthesizer), and the acoustics of the listening space
> where music actually heard (living room).” 
{% include cite ref="blessersalter" %}

In surrounding 2D audio systems like quadraphonic or octophonic the
upper hemisphere might nevertheless be populated by auditory
objects, depending on the specific sounds or composition, a famous
example being John Chowning's *Turenas* (1972). And even a proper
stereophonic recording can evoke the illusion of three-dimensional
aural space between the loudspeakers. A three-dimensional playback
system including height loudspeakers grants complete control of
spatial positions/directions and trajectories of auditory objects or
simulated reflections, the only limitation being the distance of the
loudspeakers to the audience, marking more or less the minimum
distance of an auditory object (to a certain degree this can be
overcome with Wave Field Synthesis systems).

Headphone based “binaural” technologies – dummy head, virtual
binaural/transaural, auditory VR/AR with or without headtracking –
can potentially give access to the complete three-dimensional space
including the emotionally very effective private and intimate
distances to the body {% include cite ref="hall" %}. However, the
currently available technical tools still lack precision in the
simulation of head and pinnae related spatial cues; the issue of
individualized.


Nevertheless, it can be said that technically reproduced sound can
create the illusion of space: Perceptual representations of physical
space are evoked even if the physical simulation is limited. Our
perception's ability to recognize the auditory spaces of a
composition during playback within the acoustics of the actual
listening space can be regarded as a variation of Benade's
generalized precedence effect.

# The Thingness of Sound

The classic psychoacoustic models do not explain the most peculiar
feature of auditory perception, that is the perception of sound as a
*thing*. We do not hear the sound but a *hypothesis of the source or
origin of the sound* (a door, footsteps, a flute, the phone, a
voice, ...), externalized as a *bounded physical object* in
space. Heidegger notes in *The Origin of the Work of Art*: “Much
closer to us than all sensations are the things themselves. We hear
the door shut in the house and never hear acoustical sensations or
even mere sounds” {% include cite ref="heidegger" %}. Pierre
Schaeffer and Michel Chion call this identification of the sound
with its source “causal listening” {% include cite ref="schaeffer" %}
{% include cite ref="chion" %}.

{% include img-figure url="./hismastersvoice_freigestellt.jpg" 
description="His Master's Voice" %}

The very nature of sound is different: The physical phenomenon is an
unbounded wavefield, pervading space, causing an alternating
pressure at the eardrums, thus a tactile stimulus. Its perception as
a distant bounded object appears so natural and self-evident that it
is common e.g. in amateur mixing tutorials to depict spatial
arrangements of sounds.

{% include img-figure url="./mixing_cliche.jpeg"
description="D. Gibson, “The Art of Mixing” Youtube tutorial. Note
that bass and kickdrum are depicted larger and lower in space than
e.g. the cymbals." %}

One explanation is the evolutionary-biological approach: Decomposing
a very complex multi-sensory environment into scenes composed of
relatively few visual, auditory and audiovisual objects allows us to
orientate quickly in a potentially dangerous surrounding. We can
expect similar mechanisms in the auditory perception of other
species. Another explanation, referring to consciousness and
reasoning, is given by Lakoff and Johnson: “Once we can identify our
experiences as entities or substances, we can refer to them,
categorize them, group them, and quantify them – and, by this means,
reason about them.” {% include cite ref="lakoffjohnson1980" %}

# Speaking of Sound

Besides “loud” and “silent” there are barely any words to describe
the sensation of sound. When we talk of sound, we mainly use
 
* onomatopoeia (shrill, hum, mumble, buzz, squeak, tweet, splash, sizzle, ...)
* descriptive terminology, referring to physical materiality (wooden, metallic, ...), comparisons and references to familiar objects (“it sounds like ...”), and terminologies of movement and interaction (vibrating, rolling, sliding, ripping, ...)
* metaphoric materiality and impersonations (solid, massive, fragile, strong, powerful, energetic, ...)
* specific technical/acoustical/musical/linguistic/etc. terminologies
 and...
* crossmodal metaphors, referring to other sensory modalities (high/low, bright/dark, thick/thin, large/small, sharp, soft, rough, ...)

Crossmodal metaphors are most interesting here, as they are
referring to metaphoric properties of the auditory objects. Carl
Stumpf noted in his *Tonpsychologie* that we express the sensation
of sound “with a certain psychological necessity” in metaphors like
high/low and large/small {% include cite ref="stumpf" %} . These
metaphors are verbal expressions of the crossmodal correspondences
of perception, mainly investigated since the 1980's (for an overview
see {% include cite ref="spence" %}). Crossmodal correspondences
between auditory and visual / spatio-visual perception due to innate
neural connections or infant learning have been proven for pitch or
intensity and height, size, thickness, shape (edgy/round) and
brightness. The dominant metaphor is the height of a sound depending
on its pitch, also referred to as SPARC or SMARC effect
(spatial-pitch or spatial-musical association of response codes):
The respective linguistic metaphor can be found in numerous
languages. And these crossmodal mappings interfere with basic object
perception: Physical and metaphorical properties of the auditory
object can be indistinguishable. “Pratt's effect” or “pitch height
effect” describes the perceived spatial elevation of an auditory
object according to its pitch {% include cite ref="pratt" %} {% include cite ref="rofflerbutler" %} {% include cite ref="ferguson" %}.

To sum this up:
* height and size of an auditory object have each a (perceived) physical and
metaphoric dimension,
* its movement can have a complex metaphoric dimension, according to pitch and
temporal structures, besides its (perceived) physical dimension,
* intensity as well as low frequency content refer to the metaphor of size, evoking
distance and proximity,
* moreover, the auditory object may have a metaphoric shape and haptics.

# Metaphoric Spaces, Metaphoric Properties of Auditory Objects and Conceptual Metaphors

In music and specifically in 3D-reproduced acousmatic compositions,
the virtual physical spaces created through spatial positions and
movements of auditory objects and by means of spatial synthesizers /
reverb algorithms are in a dialogue with the crossmodally metaphoric
spatial properties of the sounds, specifically due to their
metaphoric sizes and heights. Gernot Böhme identifies these
metaphoric spaces as *“musical spaces”* that are *“experienced
affectively”* {% include cite ref="boehme" %}.  An impressive example
of this inherent spatiality of a complex sound can be found in the
2nd part “Silentium” of Arvo Pärt's *Tabula Rasa* (1977): The
seemingly endless melodic movements, simultaneously upwards and
downwards, evoke associations of vast spaces, independent of the
physical spatiality of the recorded sound that may be a humble
stereo production.

{% include img-figure url="./tabularasa_spectrogram.jpg"
description="Arvo Pärt: Tabula Rasa. Silentium (stereo recording,
spectrogram created with Audacity). Note that the metaphoric spatial
movement is visualized in the spectrogram's spatial mappings of time
and frequency." %}

Besides the mere experience of space due to perceived physical or
metaphorical spatial properties of sounds, one can expect a further
impact: Human cognition is strongly related to space, mental
representations are mapped along spatial dimensions {% include cite
ref="lakoffjohnson2003" %} {% include cite ref="olsonbialystok"
%}. Tversky states: “spatial thinking, rooted in perception of space
and action in it, is the foundation for all thought.” {% include
cite ref="tversky" %} – Spatial concepts of abstract thought may be
excited by spatial sound as well as by spatial crossmodal metaphors.

# Space in Composition and Sound Design

Space as a parameter in 3D audio compositions can be differentiated
in explicit, implicit and metaphoric spaces. The first and most
obvious spatial concepts apply to explicit composed space, i.e. the
(virtual) spatial relations of auditory objects in a composition or
sound design. As we experience space in relation to our body,
relevant spatial relations can be derived from spatial cognition
(cf. {% include cite ref="olsonbialystok" %}):

* up / down
* close / distant
* in front / behind
* central / peripheral
* inside / outside

Movement can be applied to individual objects, to meta-objects
composed from several basic objects, or to complete auditory scenes
(which even might induce *vection*, the illusion of self-movement in
the audience). A specific spatial concept might call for a specific
3D audio technology facilitating this concept, like channel based
(e.g. VBAP), object based, or scene based audio (e.g. Ambisonics /
HOA), and like loudspeaker, binaural or VR presentation.

Suggestions for spatial concepts regarding room envelopment
(implicit space) that can be rendered in a full 3D system with tools
like delay, algorithmic reverb or convolution reverb are

* large / small
* wide / narrow
* low / high
* open / closed

Finally, the congruency of physical and metaphorical properties can
be regarded an important factor in spatial composition: As spatial
position, distance and size of the auditory object have both a
perceived physical and a metaphoric dimension, the congruency of
these dimensions becomes meaningful and therewith is a creative
device. Likewise, physical movement / spatial trajectories of
auditory objects or meta-objects can be congruent or incongruent
with their intrinsic movement due to pitch and rhythm. Would *Tabula
Rasa* benefit from a congruent spatialisation?
