# Introduction

In the field of dance, projects involving technology are often
referred to under the general framing of *dance and technology*. The
niche of dance and technology encompasses multimedia practices
variously described as interactive, digital, and mediated, and is
not easily defined in temporal or geographic scope. Narratives that
trace the role of technology in dance frequently centre a particular
canon of European and American choreographers in the genres of
ballet, modern, and postmodern dance whose work has been archived
and disseminated via large-scale collaborations with technologists
and scholars. In part, the emphasis on Euro-American concert dance
in published accounts of multimedia performance reflects an
asymmetrical distribution of access to technologies such as
professional motion capture systems, as well as the institutions in
which these technologies are used.

Presently, as the field of dance endeavors to confront the ongoing
effects of cultural and aesthetic appropriation in the legacies of
20th century choreographers, and more broadly in movement techniques
and vocabularies, dance projects that integrate multimedia are not
immune to these concerns – in fact, they may amplify ethical
concerns related to abstraction and representation.

In a recent book titled *Perpetual Motion: Dance, Digital Cultures,
and the Common*, Harmony Bench acknowledges a gradual shift in her
thinking about dance and digital media over the years. Bench
acknowledges that:

> When I began thinking and writing about dance in digital media, I
> was very confident about the dance forms represented. For the most
> part, what I saw came from the same lineages of ballet, modern,
> and postmodern dance in which I had trained for decades as a
> performer. Digital dance was a niche phenomenon, and participation
> was a mark of privileged access to the enabling resources and
> technological infrastructures that enabled high-profile
> collaborations between choreographers and technologists—seen, for
> example, in Paul Kaiser and Shelley Eshkar’s large-scale
> collaborations with choreographers Merce Cunningham, Bill
> T. Jones, and Trisha Brown. [...] With few exceptions, there was a
> wide gulf between “serious” artists developing new technologies to
> support their aesthetic investigations and amateurs posting
> animated GIFs of dancing hamsters online. {% include cite
ref="bench" %}

And yes, I have a dancing hamster here for you!

{% include youtube-figure id="zHYx8KmLP14?start=5" description="A dancing hamster!" %}

But in all seriousness, like Bench, my background is in contemporary
dance and choreography, and the high-profile collaborations she
refers to above are key to what I imagine, or at least what I
initially learned to imagine, when thinking about multimedia dance
performance. A select list of choreographers such as Merce
Cunningham, Bill T. Jones, Wayne McGregor, and William Forsythe are
frequently centred in discussions of dance and technology, due in
part to their involvement in research and creation initiatives that
have been mobilised by scholars to advocate for the value of dance
and choreography within and beyond academia.

Arguably, a major motivation for the use of technology in the realm
of dance has been to reveal aspects of studio practice and creative
process that are otherwise invisible to audiences, and further, to
facilitate the transfer of dance-based and choreographic knowledge
across disciplinary boundaries. The need to make the value of dance
and choreography legible to the institutions that grant access to
resources has both ethical and aesthetic consequences. Given
sustained capitalist and neoliberal pressure, the who, how, and what
of dance has become increasingly entangled with the integration of
new media as a means to demonstrate knowledge borne of dance and
choreography.

That said, the adoption of technology into dance is not only a
matter of necessity, but also one of curiosity and
desire. Historically, and to some extent presently, the integration
of interactive and sensing technologies in dance owes much to
developments in fellow performing art forms such as theater, music,
and film. In the book *Entangled: Technology and the transformation
of performance* {% include cite ref="salter" %}, Chris Salter
provides a considerable review of advances in multimedia performance
from the late 19th century onwards, illustrating cross-disciplinary
spillage between various art forms, as well as disciplines such as
engineering, computer science, and architecture. Casting a similarly
wide net, Johannes Birringer has published several books that
address enduring themes in multimedia performance such as
virtuality, interaction, embodiment, immersion, and augmented
realities ({% include cite ref="birringer2021" %}, {% include cite
ref="birringer2008" %}, {% include cite ref="birringer1998"
%}). Relatedly, in *Digital Performance* Steve Dixon discusses the
role of computer technologies in multimedia performance over the
course of the 20th century, interrogating notions such as liveness,
digital doubles, cyberspace, and telepresence {% include cite
ref="dixon" %}. On the theme of telepresence, Suzan Kozel’s book
Closer: *Performance, Technologies, Phenomenology* intertwines
philosophy and photography, as well as experiential accounts from
performers to dig into aesthetic and ethical concerns in responsive
and interactive environments {% include cite ref="kozel" %}.

Notably however, in the mere decade since the books I just mentioned
were published, the arena of dance and technology has transformed
dramatically. The proliferation of portable and low-cost devices for
recording and biosensing, in tandem with user-friendly software and
social media platforms, has reconfigured access to and participation
in digital dance. In the context of the pandemic, myriad dance
artists are turning to dance for camera and live-stream performance,
devising distributed and durational choreographies that echo and
expand on developments in multimedia performance since the mid
1960s. With this swell of virtual dance encounters, the urgency of
questions related to presence, proximity, mediation and materiality
is palpable and prominent in the framing of special issues for
journals, as well as symposia and conferences world-round. More
recent publications on dance and technology emphasise the
collaborative, DIY, and open-access character of ongoing projects,
blurring boundaries between process and performance, as well as
personal and professional. See for example *Poiesis and Enchantment
in Topological Matter* {% include cite ref="xinwei" %}, *The
Performing Subject in the Space of Technology* {% include cite
ref="causeyetal" %}, *Perpetual Motion* {% include cite ref="bench"
%} and *Kinetic Atmospheres* {% include cite ref="birringer2022"
%}. Additionally, the online platform
[dance-tech.net](https://dance-tech.net) {% include cite
ref="solano" %}, founded by Marlon Barrios Solano and active since
2007, is exemplary of this shift towards widespread international
engagement with dance and technology – even as asymmetry in access
to technology persists.

From high-profile collaborations featuring established
choreographers, to the present overflow of digital interventions in
dance, questions related to interactivity and virtuality
persist. Having offered a few resources on the field of dance and
technology at large, in the remainder of this talk I will draw on
particular examples to elucidate ongoing aesthetic and ethical
concerns in multimedia research and creation. I will focus first on
bodily abstraction and representation in motion capture for dance,
looking at the work of choreographers Merce Cunningham and Bill
T. Jones in collaboration with the OpenEndedGroup. Next, I will
present research-based and archival projects aimed at the
transmission of dance-based and choreographic knowledge across
disciplinary boundaries, largely through the use of motion capture
and annotation technologies. Finally, I will consider the shifting
landscape of dance and technology in light of ongoing artistic,
economic, and political forces world-round, pointing towards current
resources and platforms for critical engagement.

# Motion capture, erasure, abstraction, and representation

From the late 1990s onwards, several notable motion capture
projects were developed by the OpenEndedGroup, comprising Mark
Downie, Paul Kaiser, and (up to 2014) Shelly Eshkar, in
collaboration with well established contemporary dance
choreographers such as Merce Cunningham and Bill T. Jones. Video
excerpts from many of these projects are available online. See for
example 
[Hand-drawn Spaces (1998)](https://vimeo.com/32776116), 
[Biped (1999)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9BiF_6gt40), and 
[Loops (2001)](https://player.vimeo.com/video/25509279?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0)
developed with Cunningham; and 
[Ghostcatching (1999)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-7Mo3cg9jw), and 
[After Ghostcatching (2010)](https://vimeo.com/87046196) developed with Jones.

Overall, the work of Cunningham and Jones differs both aesthetically
and thematically. And yet, in these motion capture videos the
abstract skeletal representations of moving bodies bear remarkable
resemblance. Take a moment to watch Hand Drawn Spaces and
Ghostcatching side by side – with the volume off.

{% include begin-figure description="Hand-drawn Spaces - excerpt from OpenEndedGroup" %}
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/32776116?h=76d63912e3&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" width="640" height="336" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
{% include end-figure %}

{% include youtube-figure id="x-7Mo3cg9jw" description="Ghostcatching - excerpt from OpenEndedGroup" %}

While there are certainly differences in the movement vocabulary and
bodies of the performers, these differences are less pronounced than
in live performance. The emergence of an overlapping aesthetic here
is attributable in part to having the same design team, as well as
similar hardware and software for motion capture and animation in
each collaboration. Indeed, many choreographers use the same or
similar motion capture systems, and the extent to which this colours
the aesthetic and conceptual outcome warrants interrogation. Of
particular concern here, is the political significance of obscuring
differences in representations of human bodies and movement.

In an article titled "Ghostcatching: An Intersection of Technology,
Labor, and Race", dance scholar Danielle Goldman raises concern
regarding the political implications of the erasure of bodilly and
identity markers in motion capture systems. Goldman suggests that:

> [w]ith *Ghostcatching*, the dance of Bill T. Jones became virtual,
> moving in a sense beyond the body. How then, if at all, does the
> work hold onto its politics? Does *Ghostcatching* represent Jones's
> most radical formalist turn? Can politics transpire in a virtual
> dance that allows neither sweat nor skin, primary markers of labor
> and race, to appear on stage?
{% include cite ref="goldman" %}

Placing the work of Jones in conversation with that of Cunninham,
Goldman emphasises tension between politics and form when generating
representations of human bodies and identities. Jones himself speaks
to this tension and argues, contrary to Cunningham’s formalist
sentiments, that imaging technologies used to double dancers are
never neutral. Rather than seeking to neutralise technological
representations, Jones calls for spectators to cultivate a
“double-vision” in which the *who* and *how* of each performance are
always already entangled. Jones asks: "When you look at my stage
now, can you look with two sets of eyes? Do you see the sexual
preference of the person, the race of the person, the gender of the
person, and then, can you see what they're doing?" (Jones, cited in 
{% include cite ref="goldman" %})

Nearly a decade later, Jones’ subsequent collaboration with the
OpenEndedGroup titled *After Ghostcatching* (2010) inspired further
questions regarding bodily representation and critical
spectatorship. Addressing these two iterations of *Ghostcatching*,
from 1999 and 2010 respectively, dance scholar Tiffany E. Barber
argues that a shift in Amercian discourse from identity politics to
post-racial ideologies served to reinforce purely formal
interpretations of of bodies and movement – stripped not only of
identity, but of context.  Problematizing abstraction as a means to
neutralise representations, Barber argues that:

> [...] retreating to a digital body as a new sphere of sociality,
> as a utopian space that potentially and optimistically erases
> essentializing information—or renders it invisible—in order to
> escape the persistence of race as visual does little to solve the
> problems of racialized looking practices.
{% include cite ref="barber" %}

Significantly, political questions regarding identity and
representation are largely absent in discourse surrounding the
OpenEndedGroup’s collaborations with Cunningham. To this end,
designer Paul Kaiser who was integral to all of the above
collaborations suggests that:

> [...] the virtual dancers in Hand-drawn Spaces appear as
> interchangeable, sexless bodies; political significations of sex
> and gender are disavowed. Whereas Cunningham's affinity for pure
> movement over identity politics and bodies-as-signs led him to
> explore motion capture technology for its formal qualities, Bill
> T. Jones used the medium to different ends.
(Kaiser, cited in {% include cite ref="barber" %})

But what are these "different ends" Kaiser refers to? Jones has long
been vocal in resisting binary interpretations of politics and form,
arguing that politics are inherent within the flesh and movement of
the performer, as well as the eye of the beholder {% include cite
ref="goldman" %}. What are the implications, then, when movement
becomes abstracted from the body of the performer as well as the
context of capture? Are the implications different when we are
speaking about Jones, versus the dancers in Cunninham’s work who I
have not even named? Are the digital bodies in these two pieces
interchangeable with one another – and if not, why?

In an article tilted "Additive race: colorblind discourses of
realism in performance capture technologies", Alison Reed and Amanda
Phillips problematise approaches to representation that essentialise
racial difference by treating it as a "matter of style" that can be
divorced from and applied to virtual bodies
interchangeably. Directing attention to the entire apparatus of
production for performance capture – from the hardware and software,
to the designers and technicians, to the performers, directors and
audience, and finally to the cultural and discursive context of
capture – Reed and Phillips argue that:

> No matter the self-identification of the gamers or performers
> themselves, the constraints of performance made possible in
> digital embodiment lead back to the identity of the avatar and the
> technicians who control it. [...] it is not necessarily the
> identity of consumers that should concern us, but how these
> identities function in the context of the wider discursive and
> technical systems that construct and constrain them. It is crucial
> to question the discourses of realism that surround motion capture
> technologies and the very representations they produce, which so
> often rely on the logics of white supremacy to ground reality in
> either the transparent universality of whiteness or the embodied
> specificity of people of color—what we call additive race, the
> reduction of racialized difference to a matter of style.
{% include cite ref="reedandphillips" %}

Throughout the article, Reed and Phillips remind us that
representation is a systemic process, rather than a singular or
enclosed operation. Thus, the interaction between a given performer
with a motion capture system is never only a matter of translation
between source and representation, but rather a complex and
continual negotiation of intersecting value systems – aesthetic,
ethical, and political. To this end, it is worth differentiating
between the application of motion capture imagery to represent and
interact with one’s own avatar(s) in solo performance, versus the
abstraction and interchangeability of multiple, anonymised
bodies-as-forms. Whereas live performance necessarily involves the
non-uniformity of movement within differentiated bodies and
identities, the intersection of computing with dance enables the
datafication and reduction of figures into undifferentiated forms –
noting that categorical markers of difference may be reinscribed in
avatars later on in order to signify realism.

Earlier, I proposed that you watch the video excerpts of *Hand-drawn
Spaces* and *Ghostcatching* simultaneously with the volume off;
removing the audio was in part logistical, but also a strategic
means to foreground visual likeness. If you revisit each video now
with the audio on, the music for *Hand-drawn Spaces* by composer Ron
Kuivila, versus Jones’ breath, storytelling, and humming, invite
very different interpretations of who these abstract skeletal
avatars are.

To explore this de- and re-inscription of character further, I
invite you – on your own – to watch each video a third time, one at
a time – but swap the music – such that *Hand-drawn Spaces* is
accompanied by Jones’ voice, and subsequently, *Ghostcatching* is
accompanied by Kuivila’s music. What effect does this re-coupling of
movement and sound have on your interpretation of the identities of
the avatars, and the context in which they perform?

There is much more to address here, but given the brevity of this
talk I will leave you with the above questions for later
reflection. I am going to shift now from discussing the use of
motion capture for bodilly abstraction and representation in
performance, to the use of motion capture in research-based and
archival projects with choreographers.

# Choreographic thinking, computation and transmission

In addition to the use of motion capture for artistic production in
dance, it has been used to develop tools and resources aimed at
transmitting aspects of choreographic processes beyond the
studio. Choreographer William Forsythe is featured in two of the
most prominent projects in this vein.

The first project, *Improvisation Technologies: A Tool for the
Analytical Dance Eye* (1999), was developed by Forsythe in
collaboration with media researchers at ZKM (Center for Arts and
Media) in Germany. Forstythe describes his intent in this project as
being to articulate the underlying logic and idiosyncrasies of his
contemporary movement vocabulary to the classically trained dancers
of the Ballet Frankfurt. In a series of brief video clips,
originally released as a CD-ROM, Forstythe illustrates the way in
which he visualises and incribess lines in space, progressing from
simple tracing to complex curves and architectures. Many of the
clips are available on YouTube here:
[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0A53A652F7A46885](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0A53A652F7A46885).

As you watch the short video clip below from *Improvisation
Technologies*, keep in mind the abstract skeletal imagery in the
motion capture projects with Bill T. Jones and Merce Cunningham
discussed a moment ago.

{% include youtube-figure id="_zt95yXWLX4" description="Improvisation Technologies (excerpt), William Forsythe" %}

Interestingly, all three projects emphasise the reduction and
abstraction of bodily movement into points and lines in space,
illustrating a Euclidean imaginary of geometric space, as well
Rudolph Laban's influential modelling of the 
[*kinesphere*](https://thespaceintherelationship.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/kinespehere-1.jpg)
surrounding the body.

The second major project centred on Forsythe's work is titled
*Synchronous Objects: One flat thing, reproduced*
(2009). *Synchronous Objects* was developed by Forsythe in
collaboration with Maria Palazzi and Norah Zuniga Shaw at the Ohio
State University, as well as designers, engineers, and scholars from
numerous research centres in Germany. A web-based project, with
later installations, *Synchronous Objects* employs an array of
imaging technologies to generate visual and three-dimensional
interpretations of data derived from movement relationships in a
video of the live choreography. Forsythe and his collaborators refer
to these derivations of the choreography as "choreographic
objects". Forsythe explains that:

> A choreographic object is not a substitute for the body, but
> rather an alternative site for the understanding of potential
> instigation and organization of action to reside. Ideally,
> choreographic ideas in this form would draw an attentive, diverse
> readership that would eventually understand and, hopefully,
> champion the innumerable manifestations, old and new, of
> choreographic thinking.
{% include cite ref="forsythe" %}

These choreographic objects, including interactive tools, can be
explored on the Synchronous Objects website:
[https://synchronousobjects.osu.edu](https://synchronousobjects.osu.edu).
Additionally,the following video demonstrates several animations
used to highlight complex choreographic structures in the spatial
and temporal unfolding of the live choreography.

{% include youtube-figure id="v2REtWg6-bo" description="Synchronous Objects" %}

In *Synchronous Objects*, data derived from a combination of
quantitative and qualitative analysis of movement pathways,
patterns, and relationships is represented by linear tracings on
screen (as in the previous projects), as well as by visual masses
and textures subject to continual transformation. As expressed by
Forsythe, Palazzi, and Zuniga Shaw in numerous talks and
publications, choreographic objects are not intended to represent
the bodies and movement of the dancers, nor the choreography itself,
but rather make available seeds of the engrained choreographic
thinking that may be transplanted into other disciplinary contexts
{% include cite ref="palazzietal" %}.

The desire to extract and transplant choreographic thinking
resonates with numerous other practice-led research projects
involving choreography and technology and in the past decade. See
for example:

* [Choreographic Thinking
  Tools](https://waynemcgregor.com/research/choreographic-thinking-tools-mind-and-movement)
  (2010), developed as part of the *Mind and Movement* project by
  choreographer Wayne McGregor with researchers Philip Barnard,
  Scott deLahunta, Jasmine Wilson and Ellie Douglas-Allan;
* [Choreographic Language
  Agent](http://openendedgroup.com/artworks/cla.html) (2009-2013),
  developed by choreographer Wayne McGregor in collaboration with
  the OpenEndedGroup;
* [Material for the Spine](https://www.materialforthespine.com)
  (2008-2019), realised by Steve Paxton, Baptiste Andrien and

In a volume titled *Transmission in Motion: The Technologizing of
Dance* (2017), theater studies scholar Maaike Bleeker is joined by
several artists and scholars to discuss approaches to sharing
choreographic thinking, logic, and knowledge. In addition to
detailed accounts from collaborators in several of the projects
discussed thus far, the volume touches on the legal, economic,
political, and philosophical dimensions of these ventures. In a
chapter titled: "Making Knowledge from Movement: Some notes on the
contextual impetus to transmit knowledge from dance," social
anthropologist James Leach interrogates the motives behind framing
choreography as a form of knowledge production. Leach argues that:

> In a context where value is seen not just in ability, but in the
> articulation of ability (as knowledge), there is an understandable
> desire to represent skilled action as more than just technique or
> control (Marchand et al.). That dance is not just intuitive or
> primitive. That is, to re-present skill and creativity in
> contemporary dance as a specific process of "thinking," and the
> outcome, a form of knowledge. While nothing new (see Baxmann
> [2007] 209) the impetus to see movement as containing knowledge
> now manifests in contemporary dance as an emphasis on
> choreographic practice as a particular kind of intelligence
> (deLahunta "Publishing Choreographic Ideas")—one that, once
> rendered in other forms (amenable to transmission and transaction)
> will be both visible, and communicable, as a contribution to wider
> cultural and economic development [...]
(Leach, quoted in {% include cite ref="bleeker" %})

The troubling hierarchical distinction that Leach describes here
between dance and choreography reflects deeply entrenched binaries
in Western thought such as body versus mind, practice versus theory,
and material versus immaterial. Positioning the choreographer as the
mastermind behind the performance, and the dancer as the conveyor or
interpreter of the choreographer’s vision is an assumption endemic
to classical performance, and warrants reevaluation in relation to
contemporary practices of dance research, creation, and pedagogy. In
many contemporary performance practices the contributions of
directors and performers are deeply entangled, such that creation
involves distributed and cyclical exchange. Further, just as not all
choreography centres on dance, many dance practices do not involve
choreography – at least not in a directorial sense. Attributing
choreographic knowledge to an individual choreographer fails to
acknowledge the entire apparatus of socio-political, aesthetic, and
technical production through which articulations of "knowledge"
become visible and viable.

In a recent digital dance archive titled *Dunham's Data* (2018-2021),
the legacy of choreographer Katherine Duhnam is examined
genealogically through the visualisation of datasets that trace
interpersonal and geographic connections integral to her career, and
to dance history at large. Lead project investigators Kate Elswit
and Harmony Bench explain that by "manually cataloguing a daily
itinerary of Dunham's touring and travel from the 1930s-60s, the
dancers, drummers, and singers in her employ during that time, and
the repertory they performed," this digital archive aims to "provide
new means to understand the relationships between thousands of
locations, and hundreds of performers and pieces across the decades
of Dunham's career, and ultimately elaborate how movement moves"
{% include cite ref="elswitbench" %}. Through a series of interactive
visualisations, the diasporic evolution of Duhnam's practice and
pedagogy invites contextual and relational interpretations of her
contributions to dance history.

The emphasis in *Dunham's Data* on contextual information diverges
from the visualisation of aesthetic patterns within the creative
process of individual choreographers. By casting a wide net around
Dunham's work, this project enables interrogation of the entire
apparatus of production through which knowledge emerges. Katherine
Duhnam is honoured in this archive through her relational
significance in a complex of intersecting artistic, cultural, and
socio-political forces, reminding us that representations of people
and practices are never value-free – even when, or especially when
they are divorced from the bodies, identities, and context of
emergence.

The niche of dance and technology must be understood in relation to
the field of dance at large, as well broader developments in
technology across fields such as computer science, human computer
interaction, and science and technology studies. Ongoing
developments in the area of dance and technology are increasingly
concerned with critical methodologies and pedagogies to interrogate
inscribed bias within systems of capture and representation. To this
end, the folding of critical theory from feminsit, queer, and
decolonial perspectives into artistic research and creation is
imperative.

Moving into the final section of this talk, I will consider what
Marlon Barrios Solano refers to on the
[dance-tech.net](https://dance-tech.net) site as the "unstable
landscape" of dance and technology, foregrounding recent and ongoing
initiatives world-round.

# The unstable landscape of dance and technology

Gradually over the past decade, and dramatically in the past two
years, the boundaries of *dance and technology* have broadened such
that it may no longer be appropriate to refer to it as a niche. In
the context of the Coronavirus pandemic, dance for camera and
live-stream performance have proliferated, amplifying aesthetic and
ethical concerns related to virtual embodiment, proximity, and
intimacy. In many countries, art funding has been redirected towards
adaptations of live work for screen, as well as projects designed
specifically for online sharing. Experimentation with online formats
such as one-on-one encounters, collective video montage, and
durational events spanning hours or even days, is increasingly
prevalent. In addition to curated festivals online, video sites such
as YouTube and Vimeo, and social media platforms like TikTok,
Instagram, and Facebook, are flooded with work by independent
dancers and choreographers – side by side with GIFs of dancing
hamsters.

At present, it is difficult to anticipate the impact that this
pandemic inspired saturation of technology in dance will have
long-term. Whether artists have turned to technology out of
curiosity or necessity, or some combination thereof, technical
literacy within the field has certainly increased. Given advances in
relatively affordable and user-friendly hardware and software, the
exclusivity of dance and technology has been expanded by hands-on,
DIY dance-tech projects realised by dancers and choreographers
themselves. Assuming access to the World Wide Web – [a privilege
that is limited geographically and
economically](https://www.itu.int/hub/2021/11/facts-and-figures-2021-2-9-billion-people-still-offline/)
– individuals with the means need not await invitation from a
festival or venue to share work with audiences online.

On open-access video sites and social media, the role of the curator
has been supplanted by algorithmic curation – or rather, the human
designers of these algorithms which determine the relative
visibility of content based on criteria such as views, likes,
shares, and more. To an extent, this more of algorithmic curation
remains opaque, and requires interrogation with regard to inscribed
bias in implementations of machine learning and artificial
intelligence. As artists and arts organisations attempt to hack
these algorithms to increase visibility, it is worth considering if
and how this is impacting the aesthetic of the work prod uced, as
well as the way in which it is framed and promoted.

The smorgasbord of content encountered when scrolling online brings
together materials that might otherwise be set apart based on
cultural judgements of high versus low art, and professional versus
personal. Contextual analysis of dance and choreography encountered
online necessitates tailored analysis of its site-specificity. As
Bench cautions: "[...] these media bring all possible dance forms
into the flattening space of the computer screen, blurring
distinctions among movement practices and communities and
disarticulating them from their histories and cultural situations"
{% include cite ref="bench" %}. This blurring makes it difficult to evaluate authorship
and ownership of work on an individual and cultural scale, at least
within existing frameworks for analysis in dance studies. Bench
explains that:

> [...] scholarship in dance studies continues to favor the
> explanatory framework of cultural appropriation to describe the
> spread of dances and movements beyond the communities invested in
> their production. This is due, in part, to the focus of much dance
> scholarship on the politics of modernist aesthetics in concert
> dance of the first half of the twentieth century. Scholars have
> demonstrated that within this field, ideologies of openness and
> cultural fluidity rooted in the notion that dance is universal
> have historically favored those with greater social capital.
{% include cite ref="bench" %}

Applying Bench’s comments to the emphasis on transmitting
choreographic knowledge from the practices of select twentieth
century choreographers in the projects discussed earlier, the
ethical implications of abstraction and de-contextualisation come to
the fore. Significantly, the inclusion of additional choreographers
in such endeavors – without a shift in methodology – is not enough
to decolonise representations of dance-based knowledge. As barriers
to inclusion lessen, or at least shift in online performance
practices, participation may diversify, but this does not in itself
constitute a reconfiguration of power dynamics within and between
cultures of dance.

The intervention of computational technologies in dance has largely
served to reify and reassert the role of the choreographer vis à vis
dancers, amplifying tension already present within the field of
dance itself. Dance scholar Jose L. Reynoso argues that while the
use of improvisatory, collective, and participatory techniques in
contemporary performance is often characterised as democratic, the
ethics underlying such approaches are questionable if they fail to
distribute social capital in an equitable way. Speaking of
participatory choreographies in recent years, Reynsso suggests that:

> [...] while these forms of labor intend to be more democratic
> because of the egalitarian ethos they seek to cultivate through
> more inclusive, collaborative, less hierarchical compositional
> processes, the unequal distribution of various forms of capital
> produced by the participants’ creative labor enacts while it
> naturalizes exploitative relational logics of capitalism. The
> argument contends that while choreographers strive, with varying
> success, to establish nonauthoritarian creative practices in the
> production of their work, the collaborative bodies whose creative
> labor is crucial in the dance-making endeavor cannot claim
> authorship nor ownership of the product [...].
{% include cite ref="reynoso" %}

Ethical concerns related to attribution in contemporary dance are
addressed by dance scholar Anthea Kraut in *Choreographing
Copyright: Race, Gender, and Intellectual Property Rights in
American Dance* {% include cite ref="kraut" %}, and further by
Charlotte Waelde and Sarah Whatley in a chapter of *Transmission in
Motion* focussed explicitly on copyright challenges in digital dance
{% include cite ref="waeldeandwhatley" %}. Acknowledging hesitance
on the part of many dance artists to engage with copyright law "due
to the collaborative nature of dance practice", Waelde and Whatley
nevertheless emphasize the need to protect dance works legally as a
form of "cultural heritage", in order to combat the perpetual threat
of shrinking funding for individual artists and institutions in the
UK and abroad {% include cite ref="waeldeandwhatley" %}.

Contrary to this emphasis on traditional copyright, much
contemporary digital dance embraces the ethos of the ["creative
commons"](https://creativecommons.org), making work freely available
online for re-use under certain conditions. In lieu of financial
payment, works shared freely online may accrue social capital in
terms of notoriety, networking, and future opportunities. In digital
dance, the rising popularity of open source and open access
platforms is a step towards acknowledging the distributed and
diasporic emergence of contributions to knowledge that span
disciplines and generations. That said, the enduring effects of
appropriation, colonialism, and systemic inequality in dance are not
resolved, but rather displaced, within creative commons
licensing. Probing the values implicit within collective and open
access approaches to digital dance, Bench points out that:

> [t]he ethics of these gestural transfers across cultures and
> movement communities are ambiguous. Digital cultural production as
> a global phenomenon thus requires a rethinking of how gestures and
> dances can circulate through media and across bodies without
> repeating the colonial violence of dispossession in the name of
> open access.
{% include cite ref="bench" %}

This rethinking of ethics and aesthetics at the intersection of
dance and technology is integral to the work of African American
studies and dance scholar Thomas F. DeFrantz. In a recent talk
titled ["Improvising the Interface: Dance Technology and the New
Black Dance Studies"](https://youtu.be/-Mi7zL1oKo4?t=2746), DeFrantz
emphasises the entanglement of technology and aesthetics, as well as
the reclaiming of technologies beyond their intended purpose as
integral dance as a means of protest and resistance. DeFrantz
proposes that:

> Black life and black creativity is bound up with stylization, so
> style is super important, so we have ways, you know, communities
> of black people gather around re-animating technologies, using
> them differently, using a phone differently, using a camera
> differently, than, you know, essentially how it was designed to be
> used. Like, what else could it do? And let’s stylise our
> relationship to technology. So, these performances do move way
> outside of the lab, and outside of the theater space, or the
> museum gallery, into the night club, [...] into the basketball
> game, into the football stadium. So maybe another way to think
> about it is how dance technology or interactive performance is
> actually distributed across kids’ Birthday parties or liturgical
> dancing and churches. You know, it just comes out in different
> forms, in different places, than thinking it needs to be in a
> theater [...]. 
(DeFrantz, in conversation with EMPAC curator Ferro Murray 2020: 45'46"-46'52")

The stress here on the distributed character of dance and technology
practices requires an embrace of multiplicity and malleability
within contexts of presentation, such that the apparatus through
which performances and interfaces are devised is subject to
continual reconfiguration both geographically and temporally. For
DeFrantz, this research is grounded by collaborative initiatives in
the lab he directs at Duke University, called [SLIPPAGE: Performance
| Culture | Technology](https://slippage.duke.edu).

Presently, transdisciplinary collectives, platforms, and research
labs such as SLIPPAGE are integral to developments associated with
dance and technology. Through an interweaving of practice-based
research with critical theory and philosophy, teams of collaborators
in the arts, humanities, and sciences are probing the aesthetic and
ethical dimensions of movement analysis and representation across
disciplines.

To conclude this talk I would like to point you in the direction of
a few communities actively engaged with dance and technology,
through which you can learn more and also get involved. The
communities foregrounded here are of course a partial sampling of
the field, bound by my own values, knowledge, and experience – and
indeed, I am involved in several of these myself.

For those curious about the philosophical dimensions of bodily
abstraction and representation, I recommend checking out the
[Metabody Project](https://metabody.eu) founded by Jaime del Val,
which hosts a yearly forum, as well as performances, installations,
workshops, and talks internationally. Additionally, the
[SenseLab](http://erinmovement.com/about-senselab) directed by Erin
Manning explores performance from the perspective of process
philosophy, and engages with issues of interaction and virtuality
through reading groups, workshops, and performances, as well as an
open access journal and book series.

Mathematician and philosopher Sha Xin Wei has founded two research
labs focussed on arts, media, and engineering, namely the
[Topological Media Lab](http://topologicalmedialab.net) at Concordia
University – now directed by choreographer Micahel Montanaro and
philosopher David Morris – and the [Synthesis
Center](http://synthesis.ame.asu.edu) at Arizona State University.
The Synthesis Center currently supports a wide range of
practice-based and theoretical projects on themes such as
prototyping social forms, alternative economies and ecologies, and
neurodiverse telematic embodied learning.

The yearly [Conference on Movement and Computing
(MOCO)](https://www.movementcomputing.org) brings together
practitioners in disciplines such as dance, music, human computer
interaction, and computer science to explore "computational study,
modelling, representation, segmentation, recognition,
classification, or generation of movement information". In addition
to providing open access proceedings, MOCO hosts an online forum and
mailing list. In response to the pandemic, in 2021 MOCO was
reimagined as an experimental, durational event spanning an entire
year called [SloMoCo](https://moco21.movementcomputing.org/about/),
chaired by Garrett Laroy Johnson, and featuring micro-residencies,
seminars, online discourse and more, documented on
Manifold. Although SloMoCo has concluded for now, the Discord
channel remains active, and can be joined upon request.

Finally, I co-moderate an initiative called [The Provocations
Project](https://www.provocations.online), along with John MacCallum
and Jessicaa Rajko, which involves a series of ongoing, open calls
for provocations on questions integral to practices at the
intersection of arts and technology. You can visit the collection of
provocations, as well as current open calls on the Provocations
website – including an [open call for Calls for
Provocations](https://www.provocations.online/call-for-calls)!

As previously noted, the
[dance-tech.net](https://www.dance-tech.net) community is also an
excellent resource.

Given the current surge of new projects related to multimedia
performance in dance, the above communities offer entry-points into
the ongoing flux of artistic and discursive developments at the fore
of the field.

# Conclusion

I have painted very broad strokes today, to introduce critical
themes and questions related to the history and practice of
multimedia in dance over time.  From the early twentieth century to
present day, intersections between dance and technology have at once
magnified and intervened in cultural understandings of movement,
bodies, and identities. Although early integrations of technology in
dance served to foreground select choreographers in the
Euro-American canon of concert dance, the current proliferation of
relatively affordable and ussr-friendly hardware and software –
along with the constraints of the Coronavirus pandemic – is
reconfiguring the boundaries of this field from within.
