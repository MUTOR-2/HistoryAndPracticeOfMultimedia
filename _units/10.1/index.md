# Introduction

The term “Virtual reality” (VR) has been used throughout the years
in various ways depending on the context. In the 14th century the
word “virtual” was used to describe the state of being something in
essence or effect but not in presence or in a physical way. In the
late 1930’s Antonin Artaud used the term to describe the characters
and objects of a theatrical screenplay in his collection of essays
“Le Théâtre et son double” (1938). The biggest popularity of the
term though is credited to Jaron Lanier who is considered to be the
founder in the field of virtual reality.

Nowadays four main definitions co-exist to describe possible
relations between real and virtual world: mixed reality (MR),
extended reality (XR), augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality
(VR). These terminologies can cause some confusion and are still not
easy to differentiate. If we consider the real and virtual world as
two poles of a continuum (see illustration below) and how the
proportion between these two is, it’s rather easy to define these
terms.

Extended Reality (XR) is a generic term referring to any
human-machine interactions and in any proportion between the real
and the virtual world.  Mixed Reality (MR) is used as a term to
describe the hybridity between reality and virtuality.

Augmented Reality (AR) takes place in the physical world. Through AR
this physical world is enriched by computer generated mostly
perceptual information. That means that an object that exists in the
physical world can be “augmented” to something different and new in
real-time. For example, a tree pops out of a ball. The ball is there
physically in the real world and the tree is added by being
represented virtually in the real world. On the contrary, virtual
Reality (VR) takes place completely in the virtual world without any
reference to the real world.

For AR and VR experiences specific technologies are used such as
Microsoft HoloLens and Magic Leap (AR) or HTC Vive and Oculus Rift
(VR) based on head-mounted display technologies (HMD).

# Some History and the State of VR Technologies Now

The vision of VR already exists since the 1960s. The cinematographer
Morton Heilig developed the “Sensorama” (1962), an apparatus for a
holistic cinematic experience. Through a boxed-like display the
person seating on a chair could see images, which were displayed in
every side of the box simulating a 3D visual effect. Additionally,
the person could smell different aromas, hear stereophonic sounds
and have body tilting since the chair was able to rotate in both
axes.  The device was patented in the USA and it’s considered to be
the ancestor of 4D cinema.

Some years later Ivan Sutherland published an essay called “The
Ultimate Display” (1965) where he describes a display that is
connected to a digital computer and “gives us a chance to gain
familiarity with concepts not realizable in the physical world. It
is a looking glass into a mathematical wonderland”. Sutherland, who
is considered to be the pioneer of computer graphics, was able to
construct the first human-mounted display (HMD) which was extremely
heavy and therefore was hanging from the ceiling. The idea was that
the person looks through the display and by rotating his/her head on
the left or on the right the person could move and navigate to the
virtual graphic environment. The HMD was working as a positional
sensor. On this specific HMD, which is the ancestor of current HMDs,
Sutherland published the paper “A head-mounted three dimensional
display” (1968).

It is impossible to sum up in some lines all the technological
advances that took place between the 1970s and nowadays, however it
is worth pointing out NASA’s developments for the Virtual Interface
Environment Workstations (1988). An HMD as well as a data glove were
designed and developed in order to simulate operational tasks
related to space aviation such as telerobotic or telepresence
control of remotely operated devices.

Biggest milestone in the development of virtual reality products was
the company VPL Research (abbreviation for Virtual Programming
Languages) founded by Jaron Lanier in 1984. Most well-known products
were the DataGlove and the EyePhone. In 1994 the Forte Technologies
company brought to the market the VFX1 Headgear, the first
affordable HMD headset for the end user. In 2011 Sony produced the
HMZ-T1 headset, the first 3D capable HMD with a high definition OLED
display. Nowadays most popular VR toolkits are the Oculus Rift and
the Vive Toolkit by the company HTC.

VR technologies are used in various fields for different purposes
from training simulations up to post-traumatic therapies and
entertainment. There is a big variety of VR headsets and controllers
(among others: Oculus Rift touch controllers, Vive controllers,
Valve Index controllers or PSVR controllers) that allow all kinds of
interaction and creative possibilities. However, the cost of these
technologies is still high for the end user, which means that VR
isn’t freely accessible to everyone yet. Many of us don’t possess a
VR headset at home and maybe some of us didn’t even have a VR
experience yet. This indicates that we are lucking practice with
this new medium and at this moment we aren’t the natives of the
medium. We have a lot to learn from a medium that is continuously
developing. What are the benefits, the constraints and the
challenges that this new medium brings along?

# Benefits of VR Technologies

One of the biggest advantage of VR is that we can create new
imaginary worlds. Worlds that don’t and can’t exist in real world,
where the physical rules don’t have to be necessarily followed. Or
should they? To this question will get back later.

So the medium is suitable to transform video games into a high
immersive experience. The user can dive in the video-game world and
be part of it. VR has been used also as a technology for the
realisation of escape games. In the multiplayer VR Escape Room
“Huxley”, the user immerses in the year 3007AD where the mankind is
replaced by machines and has 45min to solve the puzzle and save the
world. In the VR application “Dream of Dali” the user has the
possibility to explore the surrealistic fictional world of Salvador
Dali’s painting “Archaeological Reminiscence of Millet’s Angelus”
where over-dimensional sized creatures pass by over the head of the
user. Another function that VR technologies enable is the
re-creation of worlds that either don’t exist or aren’t accessible
anymore. For example, we can restore the Colosseum in its original
state and visit it virtually or make a walk through the streets of
San Francisco just by connecting a VR headset with the Google Earth
application.

VR has become a permanent feature for immersive learning experiences
providing in many fields the possibility of recreating real life
settings and simulation of work challenges. Great effect of training
has been achieved in areas that deal with purpose-created scenarios
and crisis management, Hands-On experiences, skills analysis and
decision making, and remote training.

VR technologies can be also very useful for art mediation and
education. In the project 
[“Moving Sound Pictures”](https://www.hfmt-hamburg.de/innovative-hochschule/moving-sound-pictures/)
paintings are transformed into 3D spaces in which the user has the
opportunity to touch, move or enlarge the objects in the painting
and to create music herself through these actions. But it's not just
about interaction and music. In addition to these playful actions,
the user gets information about the artwork and its history. While
the user interacts with the VR environment, the transfer of
knowledge takes place on this virtual stage at the same time. So
far, two parts of the project have been completed. In the first part
called "The Abstract Painters" four paintings of the Abstract Era
between 1916 - 1924 by Kasimir Malevich, El Lissitzky, Piet Mondrian
and Wassily Kandinsky were transferred into a VR environment and
dressed up musically. The user enters a gallery designed in the
style of the 1920s, with a wallpaper in wine red colour and a shiny
brown wooden floor. The paintings hang on the walls like in an
exhibition and act as gateways into the walk-in virtual rooms: in
Malevich you can make the objects sound with two mallets, in
Kandinsky you can touch the objects with your hands and thus create
music.

In the second part called "Dali's Persistence of Memory" the
painting of the same name by Salvador Dali was transferred into a
virtual interactive landscape outdoors. In a desert landscape
surrounded by the sea, the sound of ticking melted clocks is
combined with the sound of the sea. The user can move freely and
discover this "musical" world for himself through teleportation.

These environments don’t follow strictly the physical laws. For
example, yellow circles and multi-coloured triangles are gliding and
move smoothly on the air without falling down to the floor as the
case would be in the physical world. Do we need to create worlds
that don’t need to be based on physical laws, or should they? Mostly
we expect that things in a VR environment behave exactly as they
would behave in the physical world. Whatever breaks these
“unwritten” rules, it makes us feel uncomfortable or weird because
it does not fulfil our expectation cognitively and perceptually. For
example, in Kandinsky’s VR environment, the big yellow circle stands
almost up on the ceiling. Normally the object, if it’s not hanging
from somewhere, should fall down because of gravity, but in a
virtual world gravity isn’t a “must”. Of course, you can simulate it
but you do not have to. You have such a freedom to create
environments that would seem phantastic to our reality and that is
one of the biggest advantages but also the biggest challenge in VR
creation.

# Constraints and Challenges

HMDs are the window to a virtual world. When “wearing” an HMD we are
suddenly cut off of the physical world and we have the feeling that
we are physically present in a non-physical world. As such, total
immersion is reached through VR technologies. But what happens with
our senses and especially our body? Our body is somehow trapped
between two worlds: the physical and the virtual world. Our brain
and body is going to simulate whatever happens in the virtual
world. That means that if you are in a roller coaster in VR but you
are standing in the physical world, you are still going to feel
nausea or get sickness. This sensory discrepancy is also called
“virtual reality sickness” which is similar to motion
sickness. Walking or wandering around in VR, the so called
locomotion, can be enabled by using handheld controllers. Here
though we have the situation where the user can only walk within a
physical limited space in the real world without necessarily having
the same sized space in the virtual world. Teleportation (selecting
the spot where the user wants to teleport himself in the space) is
one solution to solve this discrepancy between virtual and physical
space. If an obstacle is on your way in the virtual world, you are
going to feel the need to jump over it in the physical world
although the object doesn’t exist in that physical world.

Inspired by the problem of how our perception works in virtual
worlds Rebecca Allen created in 2016 the VR art installation INSIDE
[https://vimeo.com/420957109](https://vimeo.com/420957109). 
In a narrative VR environment, the
user travels from a desert to a prehistoric cave. The cave functions
as a representation of the human brain where the real world mixes
with the “unreal”.  Images, sounds, virtual objects are mixed in
this cave. The artist explores into which extend our sensory
perception can be altered when we are immersed in a VR environment
and what is the role of the human body in VR. How can we enjoy such
an environment and do we find this pleasant?

Another question that pops up is how is the feeling of presence or
absence when emerging in VR environments? Do you have the feeling of
really being there or it is just an illusion? And what is that it
makes the experience real or illusive? High-end graphics? Or a 100%
representation of the real world?

All of these questions aren’t still easy to clearly answer. The
puzzle of finding the right balance between actions in the virtual
world and how the body reacts in the physical world and what this
combination can make us feel, is already mind breaking.
