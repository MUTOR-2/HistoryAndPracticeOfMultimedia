# Dance and New Technologies: an Overview of Developments in the 20th Century -- *Kerstin Evert*

## Introduction

This overview on important developments in dance and new media technologies is based on my PhD thesis *DanceLab - Dance and New Technologies.*  {% include cite ref="evert" %}
The topic is even more up to date than ever and intensified by the Corona pandemic, which increased the interest of many dancers and choreographers to engage with digital technologies again. Technological devices and applications are much cheaper and faster and easier to access than in the end of the 1990ies, but many discourses around technologies in relation to dance and the moving human body are still quite similar. In the (late) 1990s, the role of the body in relation to new (media) technologies was especially discussed in relation to the fear of the disappearance of the body.

### Dance and the “natural” body

Especially in contemporary dance the tension between euphoria about new, body-expanding possibilities through technologies and the fear of the loss of the central instrument in dance - the body – manifested itself.
This can be traced back to the phase of the so called *Ausdruckstanz* and early modern dance which was very influential in Germany and internationally since the beginning of the 20th century. Referring to this important phase in dance history dance was (and often still is) interpretated as an expression of the natural and authentic moving body.
One of the most important representatives of this period is [Isadora Duncan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ppask0QQZY&ab_channel=moriundmori-Kunst-Dokus), who based her idea of dance on motifs such as ancient Greek vase paintings and on movements that were understood as natural, such as the rhythm of breathing or the waves of the sea. Ballet on the other hand (with its outward leg and feet positions and its body discipline) was understood as highly artificial.

In dance, however, as in other contexts such as sports, there is no natural body. Rather, one has to do with a clearly dance-technically formed body, which is trained and developed for this purpose according to respective specific dance techniques. These dance techniques inscribe themselves into the body over years of training and shape and mark it – as it is visible especially in ballet trained dancer’s bodies.

### Dance and New Technologies in early 20th century

Already at the beginning of the 20th century, in the newly developing context of modern dance a tension emerged between the artists in favor of the supposedly natural dancing body and those, who felt very strongly drawn to experimenting with the new media and technologies of the time.

Here are a few examples:

- The aesthetics of the romantic ballet of the 19th century was very much influenced by e.g. light-technical innovations such as oil and gas lighting as well as the use of reflectors and filters and the development of flying machines, which shaped the supernatural character of the female characters of the romantic ballet. Together with the point show dance technique that was emerging at the time, the antigrave image of the ballerina first emerged. The ballet [*La Sylphide*]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EWj4liA-rg&ab_channel=StaatstheaterKA) is considered the starting point of the romantic ballet, and **Marie Taglioni** one of its style-defining interpreters. 

{% include youtube-figure id="4EWj4liA-rg" 
description="Ballet La Sylphide - Libretto Adolphe Nourrit, Music Jean-Madeleine Schneitzhoeffer, Coreographie Filippo Taglioni"%} 

- **Edward Gordon Craig's** idea of the [*Über-Marionette*](https://www.britannica.com/art/Ubermarionette) (1908) is related to the concept of the marionette as a perfect body in Heinrich Kleist's essay [*Über das Marionettentheater*](https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/%C3%9Cber_das_Marionettentheater): Following Craig, humans are to imperfect to perform on stage. Thus, until the completion of the *Über-Marionette*, trained dancer’s bodies are to represent the human body on stage.

- **Oskar Schlemmer's** space-sculptural costumes of the [*Triadic ballet*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4pJlj_bteQ&ab_channel=LACREAM) also refer to the idea of body mechanization.

{% include youtube-figure id="r4pJlj_bteQ" 
description="Oskar Schlemmer - Triadic ballet"%}

- Already in the 19th century the dancing, moving body was an important topic in early photography and film. Towards the end of the 19th century, **Loie Fuller** for example experimented with a [special costume](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dda-BXNvVkQ&ab_channel=SocialDeception), which consisted of sticks and large lengths of fabric. She projected images and films onto this costume and experimenting with advanced lighting technology of the time.

## Merce Cunningham

Throughout his long and outstanding choreographic career, Merce Cunningham (1919 - 2009) was one of the most important pioneers of the use of new technologies in dance and choreography. The medium film - and especially film editing/cutting methods - became a central principle in his work.
He also was one of the first choreographers who developed dance pieces for TV, Camera and Video, such as [*Event for Television*](https://www.mercecunningham.org/media/media-detail/?title=Event+for+Television), [*Fractions I and II*](https://www.mercecunningham.org/media/media-detail/?title=Fractions+II) or [*Beachbirds for Camera*](https://www.mercecunningham.org/media/media-detail/?title=Beach+Birds+for+Camera).
In his works the moving camera became part of the choreography.

### *Untitled Solo*

Even more important was his work with chance technics. I suggest to read this method of determining the position of body parts in time and space (= choreography) as a film-like editing technique. His Solo [*Untitled Solo*](https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/3b874850-08a0-0133-bb47-58d385a7bbd0) (1953) is a good example for this approach: In the process of choreographing the piece as a solo for himself he basically segmented the body in parts: He made a paper list with columns for individual body parts or movement phrases and determined  the movements for these columns (= body parts) by chance means. He then went back into the studio and tried to transfer these chance movements back on his moving body. This means he had to solve the task of bringing isolated movements and phrases for different parts of the (which sometimes at the same time were meant to go in opposite directions) as a choreography back on his body:

>> “Then I’d throw two coins to find the order, by chance means. And where it was a phrase, that was what I did. But when it was a single movement, I would throw coins again to see if another movement was done at the same time. Once five different things came up, all separate, and I spent days practicing without the music, to figure out, just to remember: the continuity, what came next, was such a problem. It reordered the whole coordinating system. [...] Finally by the end of the summer I was just barely able to present the dance. It absolutely rearranged my idea of what coordination was [...]. Listening to the music was strange, trying to know where I should be at certain points in relation to the sounds, and when I was trying to do this complex dance with it, oh, it was impossible [... ] It was physically difficult for me to do that dance, because of the changes, the play of movements against each other, the abruptness of the rhythm, the shifting. [...] There were rapid foot things and then all of a sudden hands, and head thrown around [...].”   {% include cite ref="cunningham_dance" %}(p.80-82)

The quote shows the complexity of this approach: Movements were cut together – edited like on a film board, where the different film shots and sequences are placed one after the other. Even for him as a highly trained dancer the ability to coordinate the counterdirections and imbalances was brought to its limits.

Cunningham's work with chance means as a choreographic compositional technique and his abstract idea of dance as “movement in time and space”  (quoted after the TV program *Event for Television*) {% include cite ref="cunningham_tv" %} together with his understanding of dance taking place autonomously and independently from music, was not easy to understand for audiences at that time. Therefore, his pieces in the beginning often were received as abstract and cool/inhuman. A perspective that was reinforced by his work with the computer animation program *Life Forms* in the early 1990s. Although I would like to suggest this is only an extended form of his film-like choreographic editing technique developed with chance means.

### Choreographing with the computer

{% include youtube-figure id="1FfSOUjnXso" 
description="DanceForms by Janet Randell, a new digital dance resource"%}

[*Life Forms*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfSOUjnXso&ab_channel=CedarDance) in the beginning was a basic animation software, offered to Merce Cunningham in 1989 to use for feedback for the further development of the software. In the following years he developed some dance pieces based on choreographic material designed with life forms such as [*CRWDSPCR*](https://vimeo.com/297801999). The figures animated in the software can perform movements that are not possible with human bodies - like turning limbs or head 360°. Body shapes as images are created in the so called “figure editor”, which then become “key frames” in a “timeline”, which reminds of a film strip. The software can also render transitions between very different key frames and translate them into a smooth animation. Cunningham animated short choreographies and then brought them back into the dance studio. There, the human dancers had to adapt these movement sequences with and on their bodies.

{% include begin-figure description="Merce Cunningham - CRWDSPCR" %}
<div style="display: block; text-align: center; float: center">
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/297801999" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
{% include end-figure %}

Here again this approach can be understood as film cutting technique. Compared to the example before, this time the transitions between the “key figures” of the animation – like screen shots in the flow of movement transitions - cannot simply be transferred to the body. Instead, the dancers had to be very inventive in order to find ways to perform these cuts with their bodies (like how to stay in the air and resist the law of gravity).

The audience’ and review’s reception of the pieces developed with the assistance of the software polarized again. The choreography was described as staccato like, cool, emotionless, robotic, mechanical. Here again, the concept of dance representing a natural body appears again: The piece as outcome of a choreographic process with the computer seemed unnatural, unhuman - and thus in some critics and viewers evoked the fear of losing the body through technology.
(It’s not a surprise that Cunningham later in the 90’s also started to work with Motion Capturing technologies ([*Biped*](https://www.mercecunningham.org/the-work/choreography/biped/)), which made the choreography look more “fluent” again.)

## Interactive choreography

### The Body as Interface
Choreographing the stories of mostly young men who lose themselves in cyberspace, dance pieces in the 1990s, for example, addressed the immersive danger that might be triggered by new technologies (like Birgitta Trommler’s piece *Willkommen in der Wirklichkeit*, Münster 1991 or Philip Lansdale’s version of *La Sylphide*, Bielefeld 1999). 
More interesting though are interactive choreographic projects in dance. Experimental projects to give dancers control over performance parameters such as music, lighting, projections, etc. with the help of interactive stage environments have existed since at least the 1960s. 

The term “interaction”, according to Söke Dinkla , is borrowed from the social science theory of action and has been used in computer science since the 1960s to refer to the computer’s ability to output signals based on input from the user without major time delays {% include cite ref="soke" %}. Accordingly, interactive artistic productions or settings are those in which a computer system reacts in real time to human input, thus creating a kind of cybernetic feedback between inputs and outputs or actions and reactions.

The first interactive project in performing arts and in music took place in the 1950’s and have been inspired by the concept of cybernetics and self-regulating systems (Norbert Wiener). Placed in an electromagnetic field, the body in these artistic works became a component of the system in which every movement effected the system as a whole. 

Marshall McLuhan's anthropomorphic interpretation of technology is another point of reference in these early interactive works.  {% include cite ref="mcluhan" %}.  Essential to McLuhan's theories is the idea that electricity - understood as an external nervous system - connects humans in a world-spanning electronic network with geographical distances being suspended. Thus, the body appears to be extended over the entire earth, which therefore implodes into a "global village" where everyone is connected to everyone else. For McLuhan, this world-spanning electronic network simultaneously represents the end of linear thinking, since it takes the form of a field of "internal cross-connections" that are interwoven in a feedback process. The concept of Cage's and Cunningham's piece *Variations V* proves to be almost a model study of these connections:

### Merce Cunningham’s and John Cage’s Variations V

[*Variations V*](https://vimeo.com/groups/contemporarydance/videos/516179054) premiered 1965 in the Lincoln Center in New York. It was a cooperation of Merce Cunningham, John Cage, Nam June Paik amongst others. The basic idea of the piece is, that all sounds of the musical score are triggered by the movements of the seven dancers in the moment of the performance.

The stage setting consists of nine antennas. Like motion detectors they react in a certain radius to the proximity of the dancer’s bodies, which by moving interrupt electromagnetic fields and thus, trigger signals. In addition – and not visible to the audience –, photoelectric cells are attached to foot stands of the antennas. Like light barriers, they are activated by shadows falling on them. Furthermore, contact microphone are placed on props (floor mats, artificial plant, towels, chairs, etc.). All these sound signals triggered by the dancers activate recorders and shortwave radios and are controlled and edited at the mixing desk by the musicians, who thus create the actual sound shape.

Thus, this self-influencing system creates a real time composition, a concert, with the dancers working as “sound suppliers”. In 1966 the broadcasting company NDR in Hamburg recorded a [TV version of Variations V](https://vimeo.com/groups/contemporarydance/videos/516179054), which I recommend to watch as an important document of TV and dance history at the same time.

*Variations V* presents itself as a performance that shows a sensitive field of mutual influences and dependencies, in which the dancers, too, are part of a net of relations. Within this 'net' no action remains without effect on the whole system. 
The dancer’s movements in time and space and their influence on the technical devices of the set trigger sounds, which would not be perceptible without technical amplification. In this sense, *Variations V* shows the amplifying function of technical devices. 
As movements activate sound sources beyond the reach of the limbs, technology, in McLuhan's understanding, showed itself as an extension of the body.

The dancer’s movements in a way connect the performance space with the outside space. Thus, Variations V can be seen as a model of the electronic network or the "global village" on the theater. Contemporary theater critics promised this approach a significant role in a future theater:

>>"It strikes me, therefore, that Mr. Cage and Mr. Cunningham may have given us a fascinating, if extremely primitive glimpse into an extraordinary theater of the future. 
This would be a theater in which dance (possibly drama), music, scenery and, certainly, lighting, could be created simultaneously in the process of performance."  {% include cite ref="hughes" %}


### Troika Ranch: In Plane (1994)

In quite some 1990’s dance productions, various interactive systems have been tested and used. The dance solo *In Plane* (1994) by the New York group "Troika Ranch" is another example of how a 'dialogue' is staged between the technology and the body staged as expanded by the technical components.

{% include begin-figure description="Troika Ranch - In Plane" %}
<div style="display: block; text-align: center; float: center">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_MyT3E44KC4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
{% include end-figure %}

The New York based dance-music cooperation Troika Ranch started to work with interactive systems in the late 1980s. They developed the so called “Midi-Dancer”, a full body suit with sensors at joints of the body (elbows, knees, hand wrist, hips). It functions as a wireless motion sensing system, which measures the degree of the flexion of joints, mediated via a transmitter placed under the stomach. As a body instrument it as such enabled the control of stage parameters like video projections, music, light.

As a piece for one dancer [*In Plane*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MyT3E44KC4) in fact is a duet of the dancer with her own video image, a dialogue with technology, which seems to be reactive or “animated". The piece seems to demonstrate the dominance of (wo)man over technology. Technology is staged as extension of the body, operated by remote control through the “Midi-Dancer” without no direct touch of the devices. Although technology as body integrated extension seemingly allows the body to control the environment remotely, on a choreographic level the piece also reveals the limited choreographic possibilities of this setting, as the body has to serve the midi-dance suit’s sensors. 

The software developed by Mark Coniglio interestingly is named [*Isadora*](https://troikatronix.com/) – and thus refers to Isadora Duncan, who understood dance (as we remember) as expression of the naturalness of the body).

## Extended tactility

These two choreographic examples from the 1960’s and 1990’s stage the entire body of the dancers as an interface to technology. This again reconnects to 1990’s discourses around technology and the fear of losing the human body in an increasingly technologized world. Especially dance artists tried to position themselves as experts with knowledge on sensory and spatial perception which could be very valuable for these developments.  {% include cite ref="hughes" %} p.142. 

The phenomenologist Merleau-Ponty described the connectedness of the body as a seeing and visible or touching and touchable entity with the world. The body in turn appropriates the world by an intertwined seeing-touching sense of distance and proximity.  {% include cite ref="merleau" %} p.173.
Interactive performative setting thus extend the kinesphere (as the space around the body ([*Rudolf Laban*](https://www.folkwang-uni.de/home/tanz/izt/geschichte/rudolf-von-laban/)) that reachable with the limbs) **beyond** the reach of limbs and includes reacting device components.

In an article in Kunstforum international in 1996 Susie Ramsey wrote: 

>>"What is exciting and promising about Virtual Reality in relation to dance is not the helmet paradigm, but rather these are alternative models of reciprocal action within a human-machine interaction that incorporates a broader spectrum of wide and varied bodily ability. Currently, a growing group of international artists and scholars are experimenting with interfaces that are more intuitive and that materially and conceptually engage the whole body." {% include cite ref="hughes" %} p.141.

Here again we can see the recourse to notions of a body expressing itself in dance. The whole body again is understood as an interface. And thus, it is seen as is more sensitive – compared to only wearing a VR helmet on the head or using a computer mouse with the hand:

>>"[...] there are two concurrent notions of virtual reality, one which aspires towards abandoning our bodies in order to travel through digital space while hooked up to a computer, and another which derives inspiration from physical experience to create a new reality through art. [...] For me, the fundamental conception of cyberspace is linked to the moving, fluid body. It is through flesh and not in spite of it that we gain access to the virtual."  {% include cite ref="kozel" %} p.37.

Because interactive technologies and devices were considered as extensions of the body and thereby related to a sensuality based on touch and proprioception, media researchers like Derrick de Kerckhove  {% include cite ref="kerckhove" %} p.334. also referred to the body knowledge of dancers.
Thus, the basis for the development of interfaces which use the whole body, is understood as overcoming the long dominance of the sense of sight and the alienation from the body related to this dominance. In this understanding technology does not lead to a loss of the body, but to a physicality enhanced by technology, which encompasses all senses. Following an anthropological definition of technology as part of the human body, the precondition, though, for this development is, to firstly understand technology as part of the body and to integrate it into the body concept.  {% include cite ref="kerckhove" %} p.333

De Kerckhove’s approach is clearly based on a phenomenological background and by this tries to overcome the separation of body and mind. Appropriating of the environment through the eye and the hand thus is seen as a mutual penetration of the body with the world {% include cite ref="merleau" %} p.308.: By remotely seeing/touching the world, the body connects and intertwines itself with it as its extension. Computer technology and especially interactive systems seem to extend and visibly implement this connectedness: Following de Kerckhove the senses of touch and sight are electrically extended beyond the kinesphere and the actual place of presence. Here again, we are back to McLuhans idea of the externalized electric nervous system, which stimulates the sense of touch and affects the whole body. 

In dance the moving bodies is often regarded as experiencing authentically and holistically. That’s possibly why dance artists (as quoted before) as well as media researchers as De Kerckhove especially in the 1990’s referred to this sensual potential of media technology.
Like in *In Plane* the body connected to technical devices functions like a remote control: Reaching beyond the length of the limbs without touching the reacting device directly can be understood as "extended arm", which triggers effects - touches without touching. 
As the environment seems to be reactive to the user it seems to communicate. This again supports the anthropomorphized understanding of technology and – thought further – seemingly dissolves the dichotomous distinction between technology and the body.

## Conclusion

All examples mentioned are dating back to the 1960’s and 1990’s. Possibly reinforced by the corona pandemic the interest amongst dance makers in experimenting with new technology is back. Here are only a few recent examples of projects in the field of dance and new technologies:

- [deep.dance](https://deep.dance/)

- Merle Mischke Klee – [*going through something*](https://www.merlemischkeklee.com/going-through-something)

- [kinesphere: Ein Mensch-Maschine-Tanzabend](https://staatstheater-augsburg.de/kinesphere_ein_mensch_maschine_tanzabend)

Nevertheless, it seems as if the fear of losing the body and the “real” world because of the immersive character of digital technologies is still there. This is possibly although or because computer technologies are much more common and integrated in daily live today: The real and the virtual are still seen as contrasting poles, the second threating the first, while the first is regarded as more valuable and authentic.

# Dance, Interaction, and Virtuality -- *Teoma Naccarato*

## Introduction

In the field of dance, projects involving technology are often
referred to under the general framing of *dance and technology*. The
niche of dance and technology encompasses multimedia practices
variously described as interactive, digital, and mediated, and is
not easily defined in temporal or geographic scope. Narratives that
trace the role of technology in dance frequently centre a particular
canon of European and American choreographers in the genres of
ballet, modern, and postmodern dance whose work has been archived
and disseminated via large-scale collaborations with technologists
and scholars. In part, the emphasis on Euro-American concert dance
in published accounts of multimedia performance reflects an
asymmetrical distribution of access to technologies such as
professional motion capture systems, as well as the institutions in
which these technologies are used.

Presently, as the field of dance endeavors to confront the ongoing
effects of cultural and aesthetic appropriation in the legacies of
20th century choreographers, and more broadly in movement techniques
and vocabularies, dance projects that integrate multimedia are not
immune to these concerns – in fact, they may amplify ethical
concerns related to abstraction and representation.

In a recent book titled *Perpetual Motion: Dance, Digital Cultures,
and the Common*, Harmony Bench acknowledges a gradual shift in her
thinking about dance and digital media over the years. Bench
acknowledges that:

> When I began thinking and writing about dance in digital media, I
> was very confident about the dance forms represented. For the most
> part, what I saw came from the same lineages of ballet, modern,
> and postmodern dance in which I had trained for decades as a
> performer. Digital dance was a niche phenomenon, and participation
> was a mark of privileged access to the enabling resources and
> technological infrastructures that enabled high-profile
> collaborations between choreographers and technologists—seen, for
> example, in Paul Kaiser and Shelley Eshkar’s large-scale
> collaborations with choreographers Merce Cunningham, Bill

> animated GIFs of dancing hamsters online. {% include cite
ref="bench" %}

And yes, I have a dancing hamster here for you!

{% include youtube-figure id="Q6TzAQXVpB8" description="A dancing hamster!" %}

But in all seriousness, like Bench, my background is in contemporary
dance and choreography, and the high-profile collaborations she
refers to above are key to what I imagine, or at least what I
initially learned to imagine, when thinking about multimedia dance
performance. A select list of choreographers such as Merce
Cunningham, Bill T. Jones, Wayne McGregor, and William Forsythe are
frequently centred in discussions of dance and technology, due in
part to their involvement in research and creation initiatives that
have been mobilised by scholars to advocate for the value of dance
and choreography within and beyond academia.

Arguably, a major motivation for the use of technology in the realm
of dance has been to reveal aspects of studio practice and creative
process that are otherwise invisible to audiences, and further, to
facilitate the transfer of dance-based and choreographic knowledge
across disciplinary boundaries. The need to make the value of dance
and choreography legible to the institutions that grant access to
resources has both ethical and aesthetic consequences. Given
sustained capitalist and neoliberal pressure, the who, how, and what
of dance has become increasingly entangled with the integration of
new media as a means to demonstrate knowledge borne of dance and
choreography.

That said, the adoption of technology into dance is not only a
matter of necessity, but also one of curiosity and
desire. Historically, and to some extent presently, the integration
of interactive and sensing technologies in dance owes much to
developments in fellow performing art forms such as theater, music,
and film. In the book *Entangled: Technology and the transformation
of performance* {% include cite ref="salter" %}, Chris Salter
provides a considerable review of advances in multimedia performance
from the late 19th century onwards, illustrating cross-disciplinary
spillage between various art forms, as well as disciplines such as
engineering, computer science, and architecture. Casting a similarly
wide net, Johannes Birringer has published several books that
address enduring themes in multimedia performance such as
virtuality, interaction, embodiment, immersion, and augmented
realities ({% include cite ref="birringer2021" %}, {% include cite
ref="birringer2008" %}, {% include cite ref="birringer1998"
%}). Relatedly, in *Digital Performance* Steve Dixon discusses the
role of computer technologies in multimedia performance over the
course of the 20th century, interrogating notions such as liveness,
digital doubles, cyberspace, and telepresence {% include cite
ref="dixon" %}. On the theme of telepresence, Suzan Kozel’s book
Closer: *Performance, Technologies, Phenomenology* intertwines
philosophy and photography, as well as experiential accounts from
performers to dig into aesthetic and ethical concerns in responsive
and interactive environments {% include cite ref="kozel" %}.

Notably however, in the mere decade since the books I just mentioned
were published, the arena of dance and technology has transformed
dramatically. The proliferation of portable and low-cost devices for
recording and biosensing, in tandem with user-friendly software and
social media platforms, has reconfigured access to and participation
in digital dance. In the context of the pandemic, myriad dance
artists are turning to dance for camera and live-stream performance,
devising distributed and durational choreographies that echo and
expand on developments in multimedia performance since the mid
1960s. With this swell of virtual dance encounters, the urgency of
questions related to presence, proximity, mediation and materiality
is palpable and prominent in the framing of special issues for
journals, as well as symposia and conferences world-round. More
recent publications on dance and technology emphasise the
collaborative, DIY, and open-access character of ongoing projects,
blurring boundaries between process and performance, as well as
personal and professional. See for example *Poiesis and Enchantment
in Topological Matter* {% include cite ref="xinwei" %}, *The
Performing Subject in the Space of Technology* {% include cite
ref="causeyetal" %}, *Perpetual Motion* {% include cite ref="bench"
%} and *Kinetic Atmospheres* {% include cite ref="birringer2022"
%}. Additionally, the online platform
[dance-tech.net](https://dance-tech.net) {% include cite
ref="solano" %}, founded by Marlon Barrios Solano and active since
2007, is exemplary of this shift towards widespread international
engagement with dance and technology – even as asymmetry in access
to technology persists.

{% include youtube-figure id="SWR_9AxI5-E" description="dance-tech.net: Intro trailer" %}

From high-profile collaborations featuring established
choreographers, to the present overflow of digital interventions in
dance, questions related to interactivity and virtuality
persist. Having offered a few resources on the field of dance and
technology at large, in the remainder of this talk I will draw on
particular examples to elucidate ongoing aesthetic and ethical
concerns in multimedia research and creation. I will focus first on
bodily abstraction and representation in motion capture for dance,
looking at the work of choreographers Merce Cunningham and Bill
T. Jones in collaboration with the OpenEndedGroup. Next, I will
present research-based and archival projects aimed at the
transmission of dance-based and choreographic knowledge across
disciplinary boundaries, largely through the use of motion capture
and annotation technologies. Finally, I will consider the shifting
landscape of dance and technology in light of ongoing artistic,
economic, and political forces world-round, pointing towards current
resources and platforms for critical engagement.

## Motion capture, erasure, abstraction, and representation

From the late 1990s onwards, several notable motion capture
projects were developed by the OpenEndedGroup, comprising Mark
Downie, Paul Kaiser, and (up to 2014) Shelly Eshkar, in
collaboration with well established contemporary dance
choreographers such as Merce Cunningham and Bill T. Jones. Video
excerpts from many of these projects are available online. See for
example 
[Hand-drawn Spaces (1998)](https://vimeo.com/32776116), 
[Biped (1999)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9BiF_6gt40), and 
[Loops (2001)](https://player.vimeo.com/video/25509279?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0)
developed with Cunningham; and 
[Ghostcatching (1999)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-7Mo3cg9jw), and 
[After Ghostcatching (2010)](https://vimeo.com/87046196) developed with Jones.

Overall, the work of Cunningham and Jones differs both aesthetically
and thematically. And yet, in these motion capture videos the
abstract skeletal representations of moving bodies bear remarkable
resemblance. Take a moment to watch Hand Drawn Spaces and
Ghostcatching side by side – with the volume off.

{% include begin-figure description="Hand-drawn Spaces - excerpt from OpenEndedGroup" %}
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/32776116?h=76d63912e3&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" width="640" height="336" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
{% include end-figure %}

{% include youtube-figure id="x-7Mo3cg9jw" description="Ghostcatching - excerpt from OpenEndedGroup" %}

While there are certainly differences in the movement vocabulary and
bodies of the performers, these differences are less pronounced than
in live performance. The emergence of an overlapping aesthetic here
is attributable in part to having the same design team, as well as
similar hardware and software for motion capture and animation in
each collaboration. Indeed, many choreographers use the same or
similar motion capture systems, and the extent to which this colours
the aesthetic and conceptual outcome warrants interrogation. Of
particular concern here, is the political significance of obscuring
differences in representations of human bodies and movement.

In an article titled "Ghostcatching: An Intersection of Technology,
Labor, and Race", dance scholar Danielle Goldman raises concern
regarding the political implications of the erasure of bodilly and
identity markers in motion capture systems. Goldman suggests that:

> [w]ith *Ghostcatching*, the dance of Bill T. Jones became virtual,
> moving in a sense beyond the body. How then, if at all, does the
> work hold onto its politics? Does *Ghostcatching* represent Jones's
> most radical formalist turn? Can politics transpire in a virtual
> dance that allows neither sweat nor skin, primary markers of labor
> and race, to appear on stage?
{% include cite ref="goldman" %}

Placing the work of Jones in conversation with that of Cunninham,
Goldman emphasises tension between politics and form when generating
representations of human bodies and identities. Jones himself speaks
to this tension and argues, contrary to Cunningham’s formalist
sentiments, that imaging technologies used to double dancers are
never neutral. Rather than seeking to neutralise technological
representations, Jones calls for spectators to cultivate a
“double-vision” in which the *who* and *how* of each performance are
always already entangled. Jones asks: "When you look at my stage
now, can you look with two sets of eyes? Do you see the sexual
preference of the person, the race of the person, the gender of the
person, and then, can you see what they're doing?" (Jones, cited in 
{% include cite ref="goldman" %})

Nearly a decade later, Jones’ subsequent collaboration with the
OpenEndedGroup titled *After Ghostcatching* (2010) inspired further
questions regarding bodily representation and critical
spectatorship. Addressing these two iterations of *Ghostcatching*,
from 1999 and 2010 respectively, dance scholar Tiffany E. Barber
argues that a shift in Amercian discourse from identity politics to
post-racial ideologies served to reinforce purely formal
interpretations of of bodies and movement – stripped not only of
identity, but of context.  Problematizing abstraction as a means to
neutralise representations, Barber argues that:

> [...] retreating to a digital body as a new sphere of sociality,
> as a utopian space that potentially and optimistically erases
> essentializing information—or renders it invisible—in order to
> escape the persistence of race as visual does little to solve the
> problems of racialized looking practices.
{% include cite ref="barber" %}

Significantly, political questions regarding identity and
representation are largely absent in discourse surrounding the
OpenEndedGroup’s collaborations with Cunningham. To this end,
designer Paul Kaiser who was integral to all of the above
collaborations suggests that:

> [...] the virtual dancers in Hand-drawn Spaces appear as
> interchangeable, sexless bodies; political significations of sex
> and gender are disavowed. Whereas Cunningham's affinity for pure
> movement over identity politics and bodies-as-signs led him to
> explore motion capture technology for its formal qualities, Bill
> T. Jones used the medium to different ends.
(Kaiser, cited in {% include cite ref="barber" %})

But what are these "different ends" Kaiser refers to? Jones has long
been vocal in resisting binary interpretations of politics and form,
arguing that politics are inherent within the flesh and movement of
the performer, as well as the eye of the beholder {% include cite
ref="goldman" %}. What are the implications, then, when movement
becomes abstracted from the body of the performer as well as the
context of capture? Are the implications different when we are
speaking about Jones, versus the dancers in Cunninham’s work who I
have not even named? Are the digital bodies in these two pieces
interchangeable with one another – and if not, why?

In an article tilted "Additive race: colorblind discourses of
realism in performance capture technologies", Alison Reed and Amanda
Phillips problematise approaches to representation that essentialise
racial difference by treating it as a "matter of style" that can be
divorced from and applied to virtual bodies
interchangeably. Directing attention to the entire apparatus of
production for performance capture – from the hardware and software,
to the designers and technicians, to the performers, directors and
audience, and finally to the cultural and discursive context of
capture – Reed and Phillips argue that:

> No matter the self-identification of the gamers or performers
> themselves, the constraints of performance made possible in
> digital embodiment lead back to the identity of the avatar and the
> technicians who control it. [...] it is not necessarily the
> identity of consumers that should concern us, but how these
> identities function in the context of the wider discursive and
> technical systems that construct and constrain them. It is crucial
> to question the discourses of realism that surround motion capture
> technologies and the very representations they produce, which so
> often rely on the logics of white supremacy to ground reality in
> either the transparent universality of whiteness or the embodied
> specificity of people of color—what we call additive race, the
> reduction of racialized difference to a matter of style.
{% include cite ref="reedandphillips" %}

Throughout the article, Reed and Phillips remind us that
representation is a systemic process, rather than a singular or
enclosed operation. Thus, the interaction between a given performer
with a motion capture system is never only a matter of translation
between source and representation, but rather a complex and
continual negotiation of intersecting value systems – aesthetic,
ethical, and political. To this end, it is worth differentiating
between the application of motion capture imagery to represent and
interact with one’s own avatar(s) in solo performance, versus the
abstraction and interchangeability of multiple, anonymised
bodies-as-forms. Whereas live performance necessarily involves the
non-uniformity of movement within differentiated bodies and
identities, the intersection of computing with dance enables the
datafication and reduction of figures into undifferentiated forms –
noting that categorical markers of difference may be reinscribed in
avatars later on in order to signify realism.

Earlier, I proposed that you watch the video excerpts of *Hand-drawn
Spaces* and *Ghostcatching* simultaneously with the volume off;
removing the audio was in part logistical, but also a strategic
means to foreground visual likeness. If you revisit each video now
with the audio on, the music for *Hand-drawn Spaces* by composer Ron
Kuivila, versus Jones’ breath, storytelling, and humming, invite
very different interpretations of who these abstract skeletal
avatars are.

To explore this de- and re-inscription of character further, I
invite you – on your own – to watch each video a third time, one at
a time – but swap the music – such that *Hand-drawn Spaces* is
accompanied by Jones’ voice, and subsequently, *Ghostcatching* is
accompanied by Kuivila’s music. What effect does this re-coupling of
movement and sound have on your interpretation of the identities of
the avatars, and the context in which they perform?

There is much more to address here, but given the brevity of this
talk I will leave you with the above questions for later
reflection. I am going to shift now from discussing the use of
motion capture for bodilly abstraction and representation in
performance, to the use of motion capture in research-based and
archival projects with choreographers.

## Choreographic thinking, computation and transmission

In addition to the use of motion capture for artistic production in
dance, it has been used to develop tools and resources aimed at
transmitting aspects of choreographic processes beyond the
studio. Choreographer William Forsythe is featured in two of the
most prominent projects in this vein.

The first project, *Improvisation Technologies: A Tool for the
Analytical Dance Eye* (1999), was developed by Forsythe in
collaboration with media researchers at ZKM (Center for Arts and
Media) in Germany. Forstythe describes his intent in this project as
being to articulate the underlying logic and idiosyncrasies of his
contemporary movement vocabulary to the classically trained dancers
of the Ballet Frankfurt. In a series of brief video clips,
originally released as a CD-ROM, Forstythe illustrates the way in
which he visualises and incribess lines in space, progressing from
simple tracing to complex curves and architectures. Many of the
clips are available on YouTube here:
[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0A53A652F7A46885](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0A53A652F7A46885).

As you watch the short video clip below from *Improvisation
Technologies*, keep in mind the abstract skeletal imagery in the
motion capture projects with Bill T. Jones and Merce Cunningham
discussed a moment ago.

{% include youtube-figure id="_zt95yXWLX4" description="Improvisation Technologies (excerpt), William Forsythe" %}

Interestingly, all three projects emphasise the reduction and
abstraction of bodily movement into points and lines in space,
illustrating a Euclidean imaginary of geometric space, as well
Rudolph Laban's influential modelling of the 
[*kinesphere*](https://thespaceintherelationship.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/kinespehere-1.jpg)
surrounding the body.

The second major project centred on Forsythe's work is titled
*Synchronous Objects: One flat thing, reproduced*
(2009). *Synchronous Objects* was developed by Forsythe in
collaboration with Maria Palazzi and Norah Zuniga Shaw at the Ohio
State University, as well as designers, engineers, and scholars from
numerous research centres in Germany. A web-based project, with
later installations, *Synchronous Objects* employs an array of
imaging technologies to generate visual and three-dimensional
interpretations of data derived from movement relationships in a
video of the live choreography. Forsythe and his collaborators refer
to these derivations of the choreography as "choreographic
objects". Forsythe explains that:

> A choreographic object is not a substitute for the body, but
> rather an alternative site for the understanding of potential
> instigation and organization of action to reside. Ideally,
> choreographic ideas in this form would draw an attentive, diverse
> readership that would eventually understand and, hopefully,
> champion the innumerable manifestations, old and new, of
> choreographic thinking.
{% include cite ref="forsythe" %}

These choreographic objects, including interactive tools, can be
explored on the Synchronous Objects website:
[https://synchronousobjects.osu.edu](https://synchronousobjects.osu.edu).
Additionally,the following video demonstrates several animations
used to highlight complex choreographic structures in the spatial
and temporal unfolding of the live choreography.

{% include youtube-figure id="v2REtWg6-bo" description="Synchronous Objects" %}

In *Synchronous Objects*, data derived from a combination of
quantitative and qualitative analysis of movement pathways,
patterns, and relationships is represented by linear tracings on
screen (as in the previous projects), as well as by visual masses
and textures subject to continual transformation. As expressed by
Forsythe, Palazzi, and Zuniga Shaw in numerous talks and
publications, choreographic objects are not intended to represent
the bodies and movement of the dancers, nor the choreography itself,
but rather make available seeds of the engrained choreographic
thinking that may be transplanted into other disciplinary contexts
{% include cite ref="palazzietal" %}.

The desire to extract and transplant choreographic thinking
resonates with numerous other practice-led research projects
involving choreography and technology and in the past decade. See
for example:

  and Florian Jenett, featuring choreographers Deborah Hay, Jonathan
  Burrows & Matteo Fargion, Bebe Miller and Thomas Hauert – with a
  second phase forthcoming.

In a volume titled *Transmission in Motion: The Technologizing of
Dance* (2017), theater studies scholar Maaike Bleeker is joined by
several artists and scholars to discuss approaches to sharing
choreographic thinking, logic, and knowledge. In addition to
detailed accounts from collaborators in several of the projects
discussed thus far, the volume touches on the legal, economic,
political, and philosophical dimensions of these ventures. In a
chapter titled: "Making Knowledge from Movement: Some notes on the
contextual impetus to transmit knowledge from dance," social
anthropologist James Leach interrogates the motives behind framing
choreography as a form of knowledge production. Leach argues that:

> In a context where value is seen not just in ability, but in the
> articulation of ability (as knowledge), there is an understandable
> desire to represent skilled action as more than just technique or
> control (Marchand et al.). That dance is not just intuitive or
> primitive. That is, to re-present skill and creativity in
> contemporary dance as a specific process of "thinking," and the
> outcome, a form of knowledge. While nothing new (see Baxmann
> [2007] 209) the impetus to see movement as containing knowledge
> now manifests in contemporary dance as an emphasis on
> choreographic practice as a particular kind of intelligence
> (deLahunta "Publishing Choreographic Ideas")—one that, once
> rendered in other forms (amenable to transmission and transaction)
> will be both visible, and communicable, as a contribution to wider
> cultural and economic development [...]
(Leach, quoted in {% include cite ref="bleeker" %})

The troubling hierarchical distinction that Leach describes here
between dance and choreography reflects deeply entrenched binaries
in Western thought such as body versus mind, practice versus theory,
and material versus immaterial. Positioning the choreographer as the
mastermind behind the performance, and the dancer as the conveyor or
interpreter of the choreographer’s vision is an assumption endemic
to classical performance, and warrants reevaluation in relation to
contemporary practices of dance research, creation, and pedagogy. In
many contemporary performance practices the contributions of
directors and performers are deeply entangled, such that creation
involves distributed and cyclical exchange. Further, just as not all
choreography centres on dance, many dance practices do not involve
choreography – at least not in a directorial sense. Attributing
choreographic knowledge to an individual choreographer fails to
acknowledge the entire apparatus of socio-political, aesthetic, and
technical production through which articulations of "knowledge"
become visible and viable.

In a recent digital dance archive titled *Dunham's Data* (2018-2021),
the legacy of choreographer Katherine Duhnam is examined
genealogically through the visualisation of datasets that trace
interpersonal and geographic connections integral to her career, and
to dance history at large. Lead project investigators Kate Elswit
and Harmony Bench explain that by "manually cataloguing a daily
itinerary of Dunham's touring and travel from the 1930s-60s, the
dancers, drummers, and singers in her employ during that time, and
the repertory they performed," this digital archive aims to "provide
new means to understand the relationships between thousands of
locations, and hundreds of performers and pieces across the decades
of Dunham's career, and ultimately elaborate how movement moves"
{% include cite ref="elswitbench" %}. Through a series of interactive
visualisations, the diasporic evolution of Duhnam's practice and
pedagogy invites contextual and relational interpretations of her
contributions to dance history.

The emphasis in *Dunham's Data* on contextual information diverges
from the visualisation of aesthetic patterns within the creative
process of individual choreographers. By casting a wide net around
Dunham's work, this project enables interrogation of the entire
apparatus of production through which knowledge emerges. Katherine
Duhnam is honoured in this archive through her relational
significance in a complex of intersecting artistic, cultural, and
socio-political forces, reminding us that representations of people
and practices are never value-free – even when, or especially when
they are divorced from the bodies, identities, and context of
emergence.

The niche of dance and technology must be understood in relation to
the field of dance at large, as well broader developments in
technology across fields such as computer science, human computer
interaction, and science and technology studies. Ongoing
developments in the area of dance and technology are increasingly
concerned with critical methodologies and pedagogies to interrogate
inscribed bias within systems of capture and representation. To this
end, the folding of critical theory from feminsit, queer, and
decolonial perspectives into artistic research and creation is
imperative.

Moving into the final section of this talk, I will consider what
Marlon Barrios Solano refers to on the
[dance-tech.net](https://dance-tech.net) site as the "unstable
landscape" of dance and technology, foregrounding recent and ongoing
initiatives world-round.

## The unstable landscape of dance and technology

Gradually over the past decade, and dramatically in the past two
years, the boundaries of *dance and technology* have broadened such
that it may no longer be appropriate to refer to it as a niche. In
the context of the Coronavirus pandemic, dance for camera and
live-stream performance have proliferated, amplifying aesthetic and
ethical concerns related to virtual embodiment, proximity, and
intimacy. In many countries, art funding has been redirected towards
adaptations of live work for screen, as well as projects designed
specifically for online sharing. Experimentation with online formats
such as one-on-one encounters, collective video montage, and
durational events spanning hours or even days, is increasingly
prevalent. In addition to curated festivals online, video sites such
as YouTube and Vimeo, and social media platforms like TikTok,
Instagram, and Facebook, are flooded with work by independent
dancers and choreographers – side by side with GIFs of dancing
hamsters.

At present, it is difficult to anticipate the impact that this
pandemic inspired saturation of technology in dance will have
long-term. Whether artists have turned to technology out of
curiosity or necessity, or some combination thereof, technical
literacy within the field has certainly increased. Given advances in
relatively affordable and user-friendly hardware and software, the
exclusivity of dance and technology has been expanded by hands-on,
DIY dance-tech projects realised by dancers and choreographers
themselves. Assuming access to the World Wide Web – [a privilege
that is limited geographically and
economically](https://www.itu.int/hub/2021/11/facts-and-figures-2021-2-9-billion-people-still-offline/)
– individuals with the means need not await invitation from a
festival or venue to share work with audiences online.

On open-access video sites and social media, the role of the curator
has been supplanted by algorithmic curation – or rather, the human
designers of these algorithms which determine the relative
visibility of content based on criteria such as views, likes,
shares, and more. To an extent, this more of algorithmic curation
remains opaque, and requires interrogation with regard to inscribed
bias in implementations of machine learning and artificial
intelligence. As artists and arts organisations attempt to hack
these algorithms to increase visibility, it is worth considering if
and how this is impacting the aesthetic of the work prod uced, as
well as the way in which it is framed and promoted.

The smorgasbord of content encountered when scrolling online brings
together materials that might otherwise be set apart based on
cultural judgements of high versus low art, and professional versus
personal. Contextual analysis of dance and choreography encountered
online necessitates tailored analysis of its site-specificity. As
Bench cautions: "[...] these media bring all possible dance forms
into the flattening space of the computer screen, blurring
distinctions among movement practices and communities and
disarticulating them from their histories and cultural situations"
{% include cite ref="bench" %}. This blurring makes it difficult to evaluate authorship
and ownership of work on an individual and cultural scale, at least
within existing frameworks for analysis in dance studies. Bench
explains that:

> [...] scholarship in dance studies continues to favor the
> explanatory framework of cultural appropriation to describe the
> spread of dances and movements beyond the communities invested in
> their production. This is due, in part, to the focus of much dance
> scholarship on the politics of modernist aesthetics in concert
> dance of the first half of the twentieth century. Scholars have
> demonstrated that within this field, ideologies of openness and
> cultural fluidity rooted in the notion that dance is universal
> have historically favored those with greater social capital.
{% include cite ref="bench" %}

Applying Bench’s comments to the emphasis on transmitting
choreographic knowledge from the practices of select twentieth
century choreographers in the projects discussed earlier, the
ethical implications of abstraction and de-contextualisation come to
the fore. Significantly, the inclusion of additional choreographers
in such endeavors – without a shift in methodology – is not enough
to decolonise representations of dance-based knowledge. As barriers
to inclusion lessen, or at least shift in online performance
practices, participation may diversify, but this does not in itself
constitute a reconfiguration of power dynamics within and between
cultures of dance.

The intervention of computational technologies in dance has largely
served to reify and reassert the role of the choreographer vis à vis
dancers, amplifying tension already present within the field of
dance itself. Dance scholar Jose L. Reynoso argues that while the
use of improvisatory, collective, and participatory techniques in
contemporary performance is often characterised as democratic, the
ethics underlying such approaches are questionable if they fail to
distribute social capital in an equitable way. Speaking of
participatory choreographies in recent years, Reynsso suggests that:

> [...] while these forms of labor intend to be more democratic
> because of the egalitarian ethos they seek to cultivate through
> more inclusive, collaborative, less hierarchical compositional
> processes, the unequal distribution of various forms of capital
> produced by the participants’ creative labor enacts while it
> naturalizes exploitative relational logics of capitalism. The
> argument contends that while choreographers strive, with varying
> success, to establish nonauthoritarian creative practices in the
> production of their work, the collaborative bodies whose creative
> labor is crucial in the dance-making endeavor cannot claim
> authorship nor ownership of the product [...].
{% include cite ref="reynoso" %}

Ethical concerns related to attribution in contemporary dance are
addressed by dance scholar Anthea Kraut in *Choreographing
Copyright: Race, Gender, and Intellectual Property Rights in
American Dance* {% include cite ref="kraut" %}, and further by
Charlotte Waelde and Sarah Whatley in a chapter of *Transmission in
Motion* focussed explicitly on copyright challenges in digital dance
{% include cite ref="waeldeandwhatley" %}. Acknowledging hesitance
on the part of many dance artists to engage with copyright law "due
to the collaborative nature of dance practice", Waelde and Whatley
nevertheless emphasize the need to protect dance works legally as a
form of "cultural heritage", in order to combat the perpetual threat
of shrinking funding for individual artists and institutions in the
UK and abroad {% include cite ref="waeldeandwhatley" %}.

Contrary to this emphasis on traditional copyright, much
contemporary digital dance embraces the ethos of the ["creative
commons"](https://creativecommons.org), making work freely available
online for re-use under certain conditions. In lieu of financial
payment, works shared freely online may accrue social capital in
terms of notoriety, networking, and future opportunities. In digital
dance, the rising popularity of open source and open access
platforms is a step towards acknowledging the distributed and
diasporic emergence of contributions to knowledge that span
disciplines and generations. That said, the enduring effects of
appropriation, colonialism, and systemic inequality in dance are not
resolved, but rather displaced, within creative commons
licensing. Probing the values implicit within collective and open
access approaches to digital dance, Bench points out that:

> [t]he ethics of these gestural transfers across cultures and
> movement communities are ambiguous. Digital cultural production as
> a global phenomenon thus requires a rethinking of how gestures and
> dances can circulate through media and across bodies without
> repeating the colonial violence of dispossession in the name of
> open access.
{% include cite ref="bench" %}

This rethinking of ethics and aesthetics at the intersection of
dance and technology is integral to the work of African American
studies and dance scholar Thomas F. DeFrantz. In a recent talk
titled ["Improvising the Interface: Dance Technology and the New
Black Dance Studies"](https://youtu.be/-Mi7zL1oKo4?t=2746), DeFrantz
emphasises the entanglement of technology and aesthetics, as well as
the reclaiming of technologies beyond their intended purpose as
integral dance as a means of protest and resistance. DeFrantz
proposes that:

> Black life and black creativity is bound up with stylization, so
> style is super important, so we have ways, you know, communities
> of black people gather around re-animating technologies, using
> them differently, using a phone differently, using a camera
> differently, than, you know, essentially how it was designed to be
> used. Like, what else could it do? And let’s stylise our
> relationship to technology. So, these performances do move way
> outside of the lab, and outside of the theater space, or the
> museum gallery, into the night club, [...] into the basketball
> game, into the football stadium. So maybe another way to think
> about it is how dance technology or interactive performance is
> actually distributed across kids’ Birthday parties or liturgical
> dancing and churches. You know, it just comes out in different
> forms, in different places, than thinking it needs to be in a
> theater [...]. 
(DeFrantz, in conversation with EMPAC curator Ferro Murray 2020: 45'46"-46'52")

The stress here on the distributed character of dance and technology
practices requires an embrace of multiplicity and malleability
within contexts of presentation, such that the apparatus through
which performances and interfaces are devised is subject to
continual reconfiguration both geographically and temporally. For
DeFrantz, this research is grounded by collaborative initiatives in
the lab he directs at Duke University, called [SLIPPAGE: Performance
| Culture | Technology](https://slippage.duke.edu).

Presently, transdisciplinary collectives, platforms, and research
labs such as SLIPPAGE are integral to developments associated with
dance and technology. Through an interweaving of practice-based
research with critical theory and philosophy, teams of collaborators
in the arts, humanities, and sciences are probing the aesthetic and
ethical dimensions of movement analysis and representation across
disciplines.

To conclude this talk I would like to point you in the direction of
a few communities actively engaged with dance and technology,
through which you can learn more and also get involved. The
communities foregrounded here are of course a partial sampling of
the field, bound by my own values, knowledge, and experience – and
indeed, I am involved in several of these myself.

For those curious about the philosophical dimensions of bodily
abstraction and representation, I recommend checking out the
[Metabody Project](https://metabody.eu) founded by Jaime del Val,
which hosts a yearly forum, as well as performances, installations,
workshops, and talks internationally. Additionally, the
[SenseLab](http://erinmovement.com/about-senselab) directed by Erin
Manning explores performance from the perspective of process
philosophy, and engages with issues of interaction and virtuality
through reading groups, workshops, and performances, as well as an
open access journal and book series.

Mathematician and philosopher Sha Xin Wei has founded two research
labs focussed on arts, media, and engineering, namely the
[Topological Media Lab](http://topologicalmedialab.net) at Concordia
University – now directed by choreographer Micahel Montanaro and
philosopher David Morris – and the [Synthesis
Center](http://synthesis.ame.asu.edu) at Arizona State University.
The Synthesis Center currently supports a wide range of
practice-based and theoretical projects on themes such as
prototyping social forms, alternative economies and ecologies, and
neurodiverse telematic embodied learning.

The yearly [Conference on Movement and Computing
(MOCO)](https://www.movementcomputing.org) brings together
practitioners in disciplines such as dance, music, human computer
interaction, and computer science to explore "computational study,
modelling, representation, segmentation, recognition,
classification, or generation of movement information". In addition
to providing open access proceedings, MOCO hosts an online forum and
mailing list. In response to the pandemic, in 2021 MOCO was
reimagined as an experimental, durational event spanning an entire
year called [SloMoCo](https://moco21.movementcomputing.org/about/),
chaired by Garrett Laroy Johnson, and featuring micro-residencies,
seminars, online discourse and more, documented on
Manifold. Although SloMoCo has concluded for now, the Discord
channel remains active, and can be joined upon request.

Finally, I co-moderate an initiative called [The Provocations
Project](https://www.provocations.online), along with John MacCallum
and Jessicaa Rajko, which involves a series of ongoing, open calls
for provocations on questions integral to practices at the
intersection of arts and technology. You can visit the collection of
provocations, as well as current open calls on the Provocations
website – including an [open call for Calls for
Provocations](https://www.provocations.online/call-for-calls)!

As previously noted, the
[dance-tech.net](https://www.dance-tech.net) community is also an
excellent resource.

Given the current surge of new projects related to multimedia
performance in dance, the above communities offer entry-points into
the ongoing flux of artistic and discursive developments at the fore
of the field.

## Conclusion

I have painted very broad strokes today, to introduce critical
themes and questions related to the history and practice of
multimedia in dance over time.  From the early twentieth century to
present day, intersections between dance and technology have at once
magnified and intervened in cultural understandings of movement,
bodies, and identities. Although early integrations of technology in
dance served to foreground select choreographers in the
Euro-American canon of concert dance, the current proliferation of
relatively affordable and ussr-friendly hardware and software –
along with the constraints of the Coronavirus pandemic – is
reconfiguring the boundaries of this field from within.

In a few weeks, I will join my long-time collaborator, composer John
MacCallum, to give a second lecture as part of the MUTOR Extended
series. This forthcoming talk is titled “Politics, Identity, and
Representation in Multimedia”, and will take a more philosophical
approach to questions that arise at the intersection of arr and
technology.

So, thank you for joining me today, and I hope to see you for the
subsequent talk, as well as the lectures that will take place weekly
in between.

Once again, thank you to Prof. Dr. Georg Hajdu and Dr. Xiao Fau, as
well as the entire Mutor Extended team, for inviting me to take part
in this lecture series on the History and Practice of Multimedia
Performance. Thank you also to Dr. Kerstin Evert, with whom it was a
pleasure to share this program.

I would like to acknowledge the significance of my sustained
collaboration with John MacCallum and Jessica Rajko to my thinking
in this talk, in particular through the reading and discussion group
we co-moderate on issues of race, diaspora, and colonialism in
practices at the intersection of dance and computing. Thank you to
all members of the Dance Computing Studies research group for
contributions to the materials and ideas foregrounded here.

If you have any comments or questions, please do not hesitate to
