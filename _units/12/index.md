title: Politics, Identity, and Representation in Multimedia
number: 12
short_description: Unit on issues related to Politics, Identity, 
  and Representation in Multimedia.
summary: We argue that representation does not exist, and yet 
  illusions of 
  causality and interaction between bodies, movement, and media 
  persist and 
  have very real effects in the world, thus warranting deep 
  consideration 
  on an aesthetic and ethical level. Drawing on feminist and process 
  philosophies, 
  we probe shifting distributions of agency and intelligibility 
  within and 
  between differentiated "things" – gestures, sounds, bodies, 
  identities, disciplines. 
  Moving fluidly between examples from dance, music, 
  interaction design, 
  machine learning and artificial intelligence, we foreground 
  concerns 
  related to inscribed bias and systemic inequality in the design and 
  use 
  of technologies in art and life, as well as the ways in which 
  mediums of 
  representation are always already entangled within situated 
  understandings 
  of what it means to be human.

# Representation

Identity is a tricky concept; can an object be identical to another 
object? Probably not. Can it be identical to itself? Maybe, but 
in order to make that comparison, we'd need to have a pretty 
good understanding of how to differentiate an object from other 
objects such that we can talk about the _object itself_. 
We're essentially describing 
[Leibniz'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz)
principle of the 
[Identity of Indiscernibles](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-indiscernible/),
which is a controversial proposition: it states that 
if we have two things, and we are not able to tell them apart, 
they must be identical, and since identity is a comparison with 
oneself, there must be only one thing. Especially today, in an age 
of digital and mechanical reproduction, we often see things that are 
indiscernible, like these two images. 
{% include img-figure url="./2xshae.png" 
   description="How many images are there?" %}
Are they the same? I mean, really the same? 
Is there only one image? That question is complicated: on the one 
hand, we can say for sure that one of them is closer to the left 
hand side of the window and the other closer to the right, 
or similarly, we could say that the sequences of bytes that 
represents these images are in two different physical locations in 
memory on a computer somewhere. On the other hand, we have to ask 
whether or not those properties are actually properties of the 
images we're trying to compare or not. The question is about 
_intrinsic_ and _extrinsic_ properties; is the location of an 
object in space and time a property of the object itself? 

Let's try this again, this time with some sound:

{% include p/xwaveform src="./clicks.wav" %}

Click the "play" button, and you should hear a sequence of clicks;
again, we can ask a similar set of questions, and again it's 
complicated. I made this using 
[Max/MSP](https://cycling74.com), so I had a software 
interface to a digital audio system, and that software ensured 
that every 44099 samples a single sample would have a value of 1.0, 
while the rest would be 0. 
[Of course](https://mutor-2.github.io/ScienceOfMusic/units/01/index.html), 
those digital values have to 
be converted by the audio subsystem and hardware on our computers 
into voltages that drive our speakers, which then create pressure 
waves in the air. Once those pressure waves 
[arrive at our ears](https://mutor-2.github.io/ScienceOfMusic/units/02/index.html), 
they are transduced through skin, bone, fluid, and eventually 
become electrical signals again, so it's difficult to say what 
exactly _the clicks_ are that we're trying to compare.
But let's say for the moment that the clicks are the 
same---let's say that they're _exactly the same enough_
that if one of them sounds different than the others, that's 
probably telling us something about the room we're in,
or the position of our heads relative to the speakers, but we
wouldn't assume that it means one of the clicks was really 
_different_.

This is the sort of casual judgement of similarity or sameness that we 
make constantly---if we didn't possess the ability to cognize 
certain things as being the same as each other, like these clicks, 
or these images, we'd have a very hard time accomplishing the tasks 
necessary to meet our most basic needs in the world. That said, what 
we want to acknowledge here is that when we do make those 
judgements of sameness, we do so at the expense of their differences. 
Again, this is absolutely a necessity of functioning in the world, 
and in fact we often don't have to bother with these annoying 
questions of ontology---many of the differences that exist between 
objects that otherwise appear to be the same simply don't matter, 
and don't need to matter, in a given context. In this text, however, 
we will continue to return to them, even when they seem trivial, 
as a way of putting pressure on latent assumptions about the 
relationships between "things" and other "things".

So let's be clear here: if we have two things that are difficult to 
distinguish, that doesn't make them indistinguishable---it's just 
difficult to tell which is which. The Identity of Indiscernibles 
is an ontological question, not often helpful in daily life. 
That said, if we say that two objects that share exactly the same 
set of properties are identical, it must also be true that two 
objects that are not identical cannot share the same set of 
properties. When taken seriously, this is a reminder that when we 
judge things to be "the same", what we really mean is to say is 
that "in this context, the differences between them don't matter."

This is a version of what 
[Alfred North Whitehead](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/whitehead/) 
calls the 
["fallacy of misplaced concreteness"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification_(fallacy)). 
Let's imagine that we would like to say something about where an 
object is in space at a particular time. In order to do this, 
we need to use other objects as a reference. But for Whitehead, 
there really are no stable objects, only change, only movement; 
we cannot say that an object occupies a particular location in 
space at a particular time, because those particularities require 
a discretization of space and time that simply doesn't exist. 
He calls this type of location "simple location", and despite the 
fact that we rely on it every day, it's not real---it's an 
abstraction of reality, even if it's a necessary one. 
The fallacy of misplaced concreteness happens when we mistake 
that abstraction for the concrete facts of the world. 
So, if we live in a universe where the only constant is change, 
the notion of identity, which requires a set of essential 
properties (or predicates) in order to function, 
must also be an abstraction. It is not these essential properties 
that define an object, then, but the other way around: 
it is the question of identity 
that defines these properties. Or rather, it is us that defines 
these properties so that we may ask about identity.

So, to put the premise of this talk in simple terms: 
_We don't believe that representation exists._ 
Representation is the establishment of a relationship between 
objects that configures one of them as represented, 
and the other as representation. Representation occurs through 
performance, intentional or unintentional, explicit or implicit, 
that constructs and sustains this relationship. 
The essential properties of the object to be represented must be 
fixed in order for representation to occur, but importantly, the 
essential properties of the object to be configured as 
representation must also be fixed---they do not derive in some 
way from the object configured as represented.

# Interaction and Relationality

## Things-that-interact

Although we do not believe that representation exists, 
we remain curious about the conditions under which illusions 
of representation persist, and further, about the effects of 
performances of representation in different contexts. 
As a choreographer and composer, we frequently produce what 
could be interpreted as representations of bodies and movement 
through our use of motion tracking and biosensing technologies. 
We might go so far as to say that we do not know how or if it 
is possible to do anything but perform representation when 
designing interaction between bodies and media in 
performance---and thus, it would be a mistake to ignore the 
notion of representation altogether, illusory as it may be.

If we think of representation as a sustained relationship that 
requires the construction of:
(a) the thing being represented, and<br> 
(b) the thing performing this representation
    
we might also ask about the status of (c), that is
(c) who or what is engineering this relationship of representation 
between (a) and (b), and<br> 
(d) the context in which (c) is performing, such that a relationship 
of representation between (a) and (b) is conceivable 
and desirable.

Let's address the construction of (a) and (b) first, 
as things that become subject to interpretations of interaction 
and representation. If we want to represent something---an object, 
a gesture, a body, a sound---we have to make 
assumptions---implicit or explicit---about what this thing is, 
and therefore, what this thing is not. In his book, 
_Form and Object: A Treatise on Things_, philosopher 
[Tristan Garcia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_Garcia) 
takes a deep dive into questions regarding how things become 
intelligible through their differentiation from all that which 
they are not. In his terms: "the formal condition of a thing 
is everything except itself" {% include cite ref="garcia" %}.

For the sake of example, let's say that thing (a), that is, 
the thing to be represented, is a gesture. If I wave my hand 
side to side like this 

{% include mov-figure src="./jwave.mp4" type="mp4"
width="400px"
description="Where and when does this gesture begin and end?" %}

when did my gesture begin? Did it begin as I lifted my arm 
from my lap, or as I tilted my hand to the side, or perhaps 
even earlier as I prepared to initiate this gesture as a 
demonstration of its thingness? 
And when did my gesture end? Did the wave of my hand end as 
I started to lower my arm? Or perhaps when it left the screen? 
If you continue to think about my gesture, has it actually 
ended yet? 

Now let's say we want to capture this instance of a 
_thing-we-call-a-gesture_ using a motion tracking system, 
such that when I wave my hand in front of the camera in a 
particular way, it triggers changes in parameters of a 
projected image or sound. 

{% include mov-figure src="./mickey-waves.mp4" type="mp4"
width="400px"
description="Using Isadora (https://troikatronix.com) to map information from one video onto another." %}

If the gesture of waving my hand is to be defined as a 
discrete "thing" that can be consistently captured and 
represented based on its effects on (b), (b) must 
learn to identify and respond to (a) in a reproducible manner. 
In the ongoing process of identifying and representing (a), 
that which constitutes (b) is also subject to reconfiguration.

Thus, the question here is not only regarding the boundaries 
of the thing we wish to represent, that is, thing (a), 
but also about the boundaries of (b), that is the thing 
performing representation. Furthermore, we should not 
ignore (c) and (d), which relate to how and by whom 
both (a) and (b) became individual things available to 
interact with one another in what we have described as representation. 
Importantly however, the notion of interaction can only account 
for (a) and (b)---not (c) and (d)---a point we will return 
to in a little bit.

So how are the boundaries of (a) and (b) configured in relation to one 
another? Garcia refers to the ongoing processes through which 
things become discretized as "reification". Reification is not a 
singular or closed event, but rather a relational process that 
is always already underway and without end. In ongoing processes 
of reification, each thing that produces another thing is 
itself produced by another thing. In Garcia's words:

> Something other than themselves always reified them, exposing 
their limits, determinations, and particularities, 
before subsequently reducing them to the rank of a particular thing, 
in an infernal chaos of thought. Everything that made things was 
made a thing, as if the executioner was condemned to be executed 
by an executioner, forced to be subjected to the same fate. 
{% include cite ref="garcia" %}

In this line of reasoning, there are no things---no gestures, 
no sounds, no bodies---that are not subject to reification. 
A thing must be, or rather become reified through its 
differentiation from other things, which are in turn reified by 
other things. Reification is a necessary precondition of 
representation. If we want to represent something, we have to 
have a thing to represent. Thus, we cannot avoid reification 
and representation. 

It is important to note however, that reification, like 
representation, is never a value-free process. Reification involves 
the continual and asymmetrical redistribution of agency within 
and between things such that they come to matter in different ways. 
The differences engendered between things through processes of 
reification are not in themselves good or bad, but they do have 
effects in the world. As Garcia argues:

> Reification---the reduction of our world to a world of 
things---is not an evil, the dehumanisation, desensitisation, 
or disenchantment of the world, but the precondition of a human 
understanding of the differences between things. A system of 
exceptions in the world of things is never an 'ethical' or 'just' 
system, but rather a metaphysical system of the determination of 
inequalities between things, of 'more-than-things', which cannot 
be elements of this system. {% include cite ref="garcia" %}

What Garcia reminds us, is that we, as individual people 
differentiating between things, are not outside of the systems 
of reification through which things become differentiated, 
and therefore identifiable and representable. In order to 
distinguish between things---which we must do in order to 
function---we each rely on our perception of differences between 
things within our frame of reference. These differences are not 
stable, but contingent, and dependent on the context in which 
we find ourselves in relation with other differentiated things.

Importantly, there is a directionality to the way that things 
become reified within our individual frames of reference. 
In order to identify a thing as one such thing, we must identify 
its boundaries, its limits, the point at which it is no longer 
consistent with itself---for us---without actually determining 
the ontological status of this thing beyond our relationship to it. 
This process of reification within our frame of reference is 
not only a matter of personal interpretation, but rather invokes 
entangled cultural, social, political, historical, ethical, 
aesthetic, and technological forces. And as I already mentioned, 
the notion of interaction between one thing and another does 
not in itself account for the role of designers within the 
contexts of design and implementation.

## Intra-action

So, having considered how (a), the thing to be represented, 
and (b), the thing performing representation, are constructed 
relationally by way of reification, let us now consider the 
role of (c)---that which or those whom are engineering this 
relationship of representation, and (d), the context and 
conditions in which interpretations of representation become 
conceivable and desirable.

Returning to our example of waving, if I want to design an 
interactive system in which the movement of my gesture affects 
parameters in the sound and visuals---at its most basic level, 
a 
["Mickey Mousing"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Mousing) 
effect---I must narrow the scope of interaction 
to cause and effect between (a) and (b), and make myself 
invisible as the wizard behind the curtain orchestrating this 
illusion of causality and representation either in real-time, 
or by setting parameters of interaction in advance. 
The illusion of causal interaction and representation between (a) 
and (b) requires that (c), the designer of interaction, 
along with the context of interaction, be removed from the 
equation. The moment that (c) joins (a) and (b) in the 
spotlight, the illusion is broken, and aesthetic and ethical 
questions may arise regarding how and why such an illusion of 
causality and representation was constructed and sustained.

Admittedly, the stakes in this example are very low. 
Who cares how or if my gesture of waving is represented within 
a system of interaction? The point here, however, is not about 
the limits of representation of pre-constituted things, 
but rather about how the designers and context of interaction 
can become invisible within the representations produced. 
If we pivot to discussing representations that involve 
gender and race, as we will to some extent later in this talk, 
the importance of questioning local and systemic influences that 
affect design at the level of hardware and software, 
as well as implementations in performance, becomes increasingly clear.

For any one thing that we call interaction, as a causal 
relationship between pre-constituted things, if we simply widen 
the frame to include a broader apparatus through which an 
interpretation of interaction is produced---and this may 
include the designers of hardware and software, the 
choreographers and composers using and adapting these technologies, 
the performers, audience, and users, and also, the broader 
social, cultural, and historical context of performance---we 
see that representation, causality, and interaction are only 
meaningful given a particularly narrow framing of the 
relationships and agencies involved in producing such 
correlations between differentiated things, without accounting 
for how these things became reified and available as objects 
of interaction in the first place. 

In a recent article in the Journal of Performance Philosophy, 
we argue that:

> the approach of any designer to shaping relationships between 
"things" (e.g. bodies, data, or ideas), positions the designer 
in relation to these "things" as objects of interaction, 
without precluding the designer being one of these objects. 
This design process is grounded in understandings of what 
these things are as objects of interaction, and therefore, 
what they can do, that are rooted in the conceptual frame and 
intentions of the designer. 
{% include cite ref="maccallum_naccarato_2019" %}

Widening the frame from the design of interaction between 
pre-constituted things, we argue in this article that in order to 
account for the role of the designers and design context within 
processes of reification and representation, we must shift the 
lens from designs and interpretations of interaction, towards to 
the notion of intra-action, as proposed by philosopher and 
quantum physicist 
[Karen Barad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Barad). 
This means reimagining the role of 
the designer / choreographer / composer / director / programmer 
such that they are no longer cast as the wizard behind the curation, 
but instead understood as integral to the production of contingent 
differences between _things-that-interact_. The notion of intra-action 
is not a replacement for interaction---rather, our use of the notion 
of intra-action in the context of design practices such as 
choreography and composition invites interrogation of the ways in 
which human values and beliefs become inscribed within systems of 
interaction---systems which have effects beyond the immediate 
intentions and actions of the designers.

Speaking on the relationship of interaction and intra-action, 
Barad explains that: 

> The neologism "intra-action" signifies the mutual constitution of 
entangled agencies. That is, in contrast to the usual "interaction" 
which assumes that there are separate individual agencies that 
precede their interaction, the notion of intra-action recognizes 
that distinct agencies do not precede, but rather emerge through, 
their intra-action. It is important to note that the "distinct" 
agencies are only distinct in a relational, not an absolute sense, 
that is, agencies are only distinct in relation to their mutual 
entanglement; they don't exist as individual elements. 
{% include cite ref="barad2007" %}

So what does this mean in practice? What does it mean to create, 
design, and perform intra-actively? One point that is key to 
understanding the difference in Barad's framing of interaction 
versus intra-action, is that it suggests an ongoing redistribution 
of agency between human and nonhuman performers in the unfolding 
of relational events.  Rather than designers determining the 
behaviour of _things-that-interact_ through direct and intentional 
control, designers working from an intra-active perspective might 
imagine their role as being to shape a context in which 
relationships emerge between performers, animate and inanimate, 
in ways that exceed their own immediate frame of reference or 
aesthetic vision---yet remain informed by it.

Postmodern composers and choreographers working with chance 
operations, such as 
[Cage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cage) and 
[Cunningham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merce_Cunningham), 
lead us in this direction. 
In throwing the dice to determine the next move in an event, 
some degree of control is transferred between the dice thrower and 
the dice---although only to the extent of combinations permissible 
by the numbers of the dice, and only in relation to the 
pre-composed materials to be performed in response to this 
composed action of throwing the dice at a particular moment, 
for a particular purpose.

More contemporary examples of artists working with scores for 
improvisation in movement, music, and multimedia likewise endeavour 
to embrace a distributed and relational approach to performance 
in which nonhuman agencies, for example the agency of objects, 
images, sounds, and movements all contribute to the becoming of 
an event. In his book _Media Ecologies_, 
[Matthew Fuller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Fuller_(author))
embraces the 
notion of ecologies to foreground non-anthropocentric 
interpretations of relationality in multimedia performance. 
Fuller argues that: 

> Ecologies focus rather more on dynamic systems in which any one part 
is always multiply connected, acting by virtue of those connections, 
and always variable, such that it can be regarded as a pattern 
rather than simply as an object. {% include cite ref="fuller" %}

If you have read 
[Deleuze](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/deleuze/)
[and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deleuze_and_Guattari)
[Guattari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Félix_Guattari), 
you might notice the striking resemblance in the above passage to 
their description of the 
[rhizome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizome)
[as a metaphor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizome_(philosophy))
for the nonlinear and processual emergence of heterogeneous 
relationships within an ecology, or what they would refer to as an 
assemblage. As a parallel metaphor, consider that whereas trees 
grow vertically from roots, to trunk, to branches, to leaves, 
rhizomatic structures are everywhere already connected, such that 
"any point of a rhizome can be connected to anything other, 
and must be" {% include cite ref="dg1000" %}. 
The points of a rhizome do not precede their connections within a 
rhizome, and later require someone or something to connect the dots; 
rather, the multiplicity within a rhizome involves continual 
reconfigurations and redistributions of points of relation, 
such that these points only come to matter through their 
heterogeneous connections. These connections are not stable or 
fixed, but rather emerge via the continual lines of movement and 
relation between them---even as they themselves remain in flux. 

Connecting the metaphor of the rhizome to performance, 
Deleuze and Guattari offer us the following example:

> Puppet strings, as a rhizome or multiplicity, are tied not to the 
supposed will of an artist or puppeteer but to a multiplicity of 
nerve fibers, which form another puppet in other dimensions 
connected to the first: Call the strings or rods that move the 
puppet the weave. It might be objected that its multiplicity 
resides in the person of the actor, who projects it into the text. 
Granted; but the actor's nerve fibers in turn form a weave. And 
they fall through the gray matter, the grid, into the 
undifferentiated [...]  {% include cite ref="dg1000" %}

In this passage, Deleuze and Guattari complicate a very common 
example of what could be interpreted as unidirectional control 
between puppeteer and puppet. In illustrating how agency is 
distributed between performers of all animacies at the level of 
materiality, they challenge binary interpretations of interaction 
between subject and object, and likewise source and representation. 

Turning to a musical example, Deleuze and Guattari emphasize that 
the complexity of relationships within rhizomatic structures are 
not something that can be captured or measured through the lens 
of causal interaction. In their words:

> When [Glenn Gould](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Gould) 
speeds up the performance of a piece, he is not just displaying 
virtuosity, he is transforming the musical points into lines, 
he is making the whole piece proliferate. The number is no 
longer a universal concept measuring elements according to 
their emplacement in a given dimension, but has itself become a 
multiplicity that varies according to the dimensions considered [...]. 
{% include cite ref="dg1000" %}

The provocation that Deleuze and Guattari provide us here has the 
potential to be extremely disruptive with regard to the design 
of interaction in multimedia performance. The very basis of many 
practices involving motion tracking and motion capture, as well 
as biosensing, is the discretization of continuous processes 
into identifiable points of data that can then be interpreted in 
relation to one another. But if these points are not discrete, 
then moving between moving points, even as these points extend 
into lines of flight, necessarily requires new strategies for 
engaging with design, choreography, and composition. 

Both Barad's notion of intra-action, and Fuller's notion of media 
ecologies, align with the emphasis on multiplicity and 
heterogeneity in Deleuze and Guuattari's metaphor of the rhizome. 
These three articulations of relationality invite us to 
reimagine human agency in tandem with inanimate objects and 
environments---and the implications of this are significant with 
regard to what it means to be a person trying to direct things, 
in art and in life.

Of course, these are just a few selected examples from a broad 
body of discourse on issues of representation and interactive 
performance, and many other practitioners in the arts, humanities 
and sciences have addressed these concerns over the past decades, 
or even centuries.  When discussing the notion of relationality 
in artistic encounters, 
[Nicolas Bourriaud's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Bourriaud) 
book on 
_Relational Aesthetics_ from 1999 is widely cited. Regarding 
interactivity in art, Bourriaud reminds us that:

> Suffice it is merely to re-read the lecture given by Marcel 
Duchamp in 1954, titled "The Creative Process", to become quite 
sure that interactivity is anything but a new idea… Novelty is 
elsewhere. It resides in the fact that this generation of artists 
considers inter-subjectivity and interaction neither as 
fashionable theoretical gadgets, not as additives (alibis) of a 
traditional artist practice. It takes them as a point of departure 
and as an outcome, in brief, as the main informers of their 
activity. The space where their works are displayed is altogether 
the space of interaction, the space of openness that ushers in 
all dialogue [...]. What they produce are relational space-time 
elements, inter-human experiences. {% include cite ref="bourriaud" %}
 
So already in 1999, speaking about prior decades, 
Bourriaud was recasting interaction as a matter of relationality 
between artist, artwork, audience, and context. Many other artists 
and scholars, largely those whose work is informed by 
process philosophy, have continued to deepen discourse about 
relational aesthetics.
 
For example, 
[Erin Manning's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Manning_(theorist)) 
writings, in particular her book 
_Relationscapes_, take on challenging questions related to the 
abstraction and representation of movement---not only the movement 
of the human body, but also the movement of thought 
{% include cite ref="manning" %}. Manning urges us to consider 
movements that have not yet taken perceptible form, by attending to 
the "incipience" and "pre-acceleration" of movement, that is, to 
the intervals out of which movement emerges. Manning's emphasis on 
the continuous and relational becoming of movement calls into 
question what is actually being captured and represented when we 
map causal relationships between already actualized movements and 
media---which do not exist without intervention into their continual 
becoming. 

A key premise in process philosophy, and in this talk, is that 
movement is always present---it follows, then, that any 
determination of where one movement ends and another begins is an 
aesthetic judgement, grounded in one's practice and perspective, 
and inscribed in technologies of capture that in turn govern the 
visibility and perceptibility of certain movements at the expense 
of others. When the notion of mapping interaction is applied to 
movement, one can only ever reduce and flatten the dimensionality 
of the dynamic flows integral to any process of intra-action, 
such that it is misrepresented as a matter of binary interaction.

So far, we have been drawing on many 
philosophers who challenge the notion of representation from the 
point of view of the procesual emergence, or immanence, of all 
objects and identities without the need or possibility of fixing 
stable relationships of causality and interaction between them. 
You may presently be wondering how these philosophical threads 
apply concretely to artistic practices involving multimedia. 

The primary reply we want to make in this regard is that we have 
no intention of using philosophy to explain or interrogate artistic 
practice, nor do we wish to position artistic works as illustrations 
of philosophical concepts. Instrumentalising one disciplinary or 
cultural practice in service of another will only harm them both 
by flattening aspects of their methods that matter to them. 
We are not interested in how philosophy and performance 
interact---that is, how they act upon one another from without. 
Rather, our curiosity lies in how philosophy and performance are 
always already in dynamic, intra-active relation. Afterall, 
the boundaries between philosophy and performance are not so 
clear cut from either a historical or contemporary perspective.

We do however want to offer some examples, or thought experiments 
if you will, that begin to illuminate the stakes of beliefs about 
identity and representation in artistic practices involving multimedia.

# Bodies and Boundaries

## Bodies That Matter

Thus far, we have discussed examples that have little significance 
with regard to the effects of exclusion that are a requisite aspect 
of any act of representation. In the coming part of the talk, 
we will turn our attention to representations of human bodies that 
have explicit ethical and political implications.

To begin, we must ask: what is this _thing-we-call-the-body_? 
If we want to represent the body, or if we are looking at a drawing 
or sculpture intended to represent the body, we must have some 
preconceived notion of what the body is, and more specifically, 
what a human body is---as well as what it is not.  
Garcia asks a similar question:

> Is a human being a certain 'something', a thing, as a result of 
its organic unity, its logical unity, or its arithmetical unity? 
Unquestionably, a coherence exists---a series of relations 
that connect this human being's bodily limbs, tissues, and functions 
to a biological and physical interdependence identifying this 
material thing as an organism. {% include cite ref="garcia" %}

So for some, the human body could be understood as a composition 
of material parts, operating cohesively and logically through 
relationships beneath the skin. In other words, the skin is cast 
as the boundary of the body, differentiating it from each and 
every other body, such that it is identifiable and countable as 
one such body among bodies. Garcia continues, shifting from the 
notion of the "body" to the notion of a "human being":

But a human being is one human being only insofar as it counts 
among human beings. Unity is primarily the possibility of 
being counted, of entering into the count. To be one is to be 
capable of being one of two, three, ten, and so on. To be one 
is to be capable of acting as a unity in the counting of that 
which one is, since one is one something. 
{% include cite ref="garcia" %}

Thus, for Garcia, the human body is not a thing in-itself, 
but rather a thing among things, defined through its relation to 
other such things.  But what does it take for a body, or a human, 
to be countable?

As history has taught us, not all bodies, and not all human beings, 
are counted in the same way, or even at all, in systems of 
cultural identification and representation. Think for example of 
recent controversies surrounding algorithms for facial recognition 
that either misidentify or fail to recognize black people as 
people at all. These algorithms are based on 
[Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), 
designed by other humans, and trained using selected materials in 
particular contexts. So the question is, how much difference can 
a facial recognition system accommodate within its conception of a 
human face, as a collection of pixels, before someone no longer 
counts in its eyes---but really, in the eyes of its 
designers---as human?

Several recent publications and projects address ongoing issues of 
inscribed bias and racial discrimination in the realm of 
Machine Learning (ML) and 
[Artificial Intelligence (AI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence), 
with much greater nuance than is possible here, 
so I will point you in their direction. A few excellent resources 
include Safiya Umoja Noble's _Algorithms of Oppression_ 
{% include cite ref="noble" %}, Ruja Benjamin's edited volume 
_Captivating Technologies_ {% include cite ref="benjamin" %}, and 
finally the _Algorithmic Justice League_ which is an initiative 
founded by Joy Buolamwini {% include cite ref="ajl" %}. 

We will return to discussing ML and AI later in our talk, but for 
now I want to stay with the question of what constitutes the 
_thing-we-call-the-body_.

In the book, _Bodies that Matter_, philosopher and gender theorist 
[Judith Butler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler) 
acknowledges the necessity to formulate particular 
constructions of "the body", at the same time as we call into 
question what is included and excluded from these constructions. 
Butler asks:

> What are we to make of constructions without which we would not 
be able to think, to live, to make sense at all, those which have 
acquired for us a kind of necessity? Are certain constructions of 
the body constitutive in this sense: that we could not operate 
without them, that without them there would be no "I," no "we"? 
Thinking the body as constructed demands a rethinking of the 
meaning of construction itself. {% include cite ref="butler" %}

Underlying this passage, and Butler's work at large, is a 
questioning of the ways in which bodies become reified as 
particular things that can be represented, through the constitutive 
exclusion of all that which they are not. Part of the way in 
which human bodies become reified is through the assignment of 
gender classifications such as male and female. Such classifications 
are never objective reflections on "natural" or "biological" bodies, 
but rather express cultural understandings of the significance 
of anatomical differences in the production of one's identity. 
In this call to rethink the meaning of construction itself, 
Butler invokes long-standing tension between the binary notions 
of biological and social determinism in Western philosophical 
discourse about bodies. 

To briefly explain: in what could be interpreted as a response 
to the severe and tragic consequences of practices associated 
with biological determinism such as 
[Phrenology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrenology) 
and 
[Eugenics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics)
from the late 18th century to present day, feminsit scholars 
such as Butler have strongly insisted on the ways in which bodies 
are constructed culturally, rather than being mere expressions 
of a "natural" or "material" essence. However, this framing of 
cultural inscription, that is, the idea that the body is a blank 
slate onto which cultural significance is inscribed, has had the 
unintended consequence of stripping interpretations of the material 
body of its agency to affect change in the world. 

So, although we may argue in the vein of process and feminiist 
philosophy that the notion of gender is constructed and 
distinct from biological sex, we must still take into account the 
very real effects that cultural constructs such as binary gender 
have on people's lives, in particular with regard to their 
visibility and agency within systemic power structures. 
As Butler cautions:

> [...] it is not enough to claim that human subjects are 
constructed, for the construction of the human is a differential 
operation that produces the more and the less "human," the 
inhuman, the humanly unthinkable. These excluded sites come to 
bound the "human" as its constitutive outside, and to haunt those 
boundaries as the persistent possibility of their disruption and 
rearticulation. {% include cite ref="butler" %}

The point that Butler makes here regarding the persistent 
possibility for boundaries to be disrupted and rearticulated 
is poignant; what Butler reminds us, is that bodies and identities, 
or rather, the processes of differentiation through which bodies 
and identities become distinct, are never closed or stable. This 
premise applies at the scale of individuated human bodies and 
identities, but also to boundaries on a larger scale, such as the 
boundaries of communities, disciplines, countries, and cultures. 
Inclusion within the boundaries of a given thing is always at the 
expense of the exclusion of other such things. 

## Stilled Bodies

If we agree with Butler that the boundaries of bodies are subject 
to continual reconfiguration, what are we then to make of seemingly 
static representations of bodies and identities that are removed 
from these processes of relational becoming? When we freeze a body 
in time and space---for example in a sculpture or statue, or as a 
[plastinated corpse](https://bodyworlds.com)---in what ways are the 
boundaries of the body still subject to 
disruption and rearticulation? When a body is captured as such, 
stripped of immediately sensible liveness and movement, 
how does it continue to perform, relationally?

Thinking on the history of sculpture and the "sculptural encounter" 
from a relational perspective that might be likened to Bourrauld's 
relational aesthetics mentioned earlier, 
[David Getsy](https://davidgetsy.com) 
writes:
 
> A three-dimensional figurative image---that is, a statue---both 
depicts a body in space and is a body-in-space. I can look at a 
statue of an athlete, of Apollo, of a fieldworker, of a politician, 
of a heroine, or of a fawn and see it in its representational 
distance. I am confronted by an image of something not actually 
present, perhaps never seen in everyday life, or maybe recognized 
as a character from books, poems, dreams, or the televised news. 
At the same time that it functions in this way as a 
three-dimensional image, the statue is also present for me as a 
physical object displacing space with its volume. It stands, sits, 
or lies in front of me. I can touch it. I do touch it. I walk 
around it. I move up to it. I walk away from it. 
{% include cite ref="getsy" %}
 
The "realness" of the statue in our experience of it, depends 
in part on how we perceive its agency in relation to our own 
bodies and identities. Yes, we can touch the statue---but then, 
is the statue also touching us? How does the unique materiality 
and temporality of a statue intersect with our own? Concerning 
the perceived animacy of sculptures, Getsy highlights the 
prevalence of discourse of realism in the tradition of European 
sculpture, He writes:
 
> Indeed, figurative sculptors developed an arsenal of methods 
directed at imbuing their static bodies with the impression of life. 
They spent a great deal of energy trying to convey actual movement 
and the capacity for motility in their sculpted bodies in an 
attempt to convince viewers to look past the obdurate stillness 
of their works. Contrapposto, facial expressions, gestures, and 
other implied movements were all used to simulate motion and its 
capacities in unmoving anthropomorphic masses. Consequently, the 
most biting criticism of sculpture was to call it cold and lifeless.
{% include cite ref="getsy" %}
 
Importantly, attributing realness, animacy, or agency to a 
sculpture, based on its effects in the world, requires attention 
to the context in which the sculptural encounter unfolds. 
One need only to observe the recent 
[tearing down of Confederate statues in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Removal_of_Confederate_monuments_and_memorials)
[and](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/29/tributes-to-slave-traders-and-colonialists-removed-across-uk)
[abroad](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-06-12/pulling-down-statues-of-racists-africas-done-it-for-years)
as part of the 
[Black Lives Matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter)
movement to understand that such 
monuments represent not only the bodies and identities of 
individual figures, but also, the history and ongoing systemic 
effects of slavery, racism, and white supremacy. Thus, our 
judgments of the realism of a given statue ought to also consider 
the very real, ongoing effects that statues have in the world.

This imperative to project human qualities of liveness and movement 
into inanimate forms persists even in media that can represent 
movement through space and time more concretely, such as 
"moving pictures" and motion capture. But before we get to motion 
capture in a traditional sense, I want to consider another example 
of the animation of movement in stilled bodies---this time, 
actual human bodies---or rather, plastinated corpses.
{% include img-figure 
url="https://bodyworlds.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Unbenannt-1.jpg" 
description="Bodyworlds" %}
   
In the 
[Bodyworlds](https://bodyworlds.com) exhibit, advertised as both 
artistic and 
scientific, visitors are confronted with, quote "real human bodies" 
that have been preserved through plastination, and arranged as if 
suspended in motion. For example, there are athletes and 
dancers, suspended mid jump or turn. Stripped of their skin, 
such that we can view parts of their skeleton, musculature, and 
organs, the proposed social impact of the exhibit rests on the 
premise that we, as visitors, will see ourselves reflected in 
these anonymous, uncanny figures. Writing on the Bodyworlds 
exhibit in her book _The Transparent Body_, 
[José van Dijck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/José_van_Dijck) 
suggests that:   
   
> [...] plastinated cadavers prompted visitors to reconsider the 
status and nature of the contemporary body, both dead and 
alive. The contemporary body is neither natural nor artificial 
but the result of biochemical and mechanical engineering; 
prosthetics, genetics, tissue engineering, and the like have 
given scientists the ability to modify life and sculpt bodies 
into organic forms that were once thought of as artistic 
ideals: models and representations.
{% include cite ref="vandijck" %}
   
The hybridity of these bodies as described by van Dijck invokes 
discourse on cyborgs in the writings of 
[Haraway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Haraway) 
and 
[Braidiotti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosi_Braidotti)---not 
those portrayed in Hollywood films as a 
potential future transformation and threat to the human race---but 
rather as our reality, now, and indeed, since forever. 
Integral to van Dijck's project in discussing the notion of 
the "transparent body" in relation to medical imaging technologies, 
and likewise in posthumanist articulations of cyborg embodiment, 
is the contention that there is no such thing as an unmediated 
body, free of technological or discursive interference.  
In other words, there is no such thing as a neutral or value 
free representation of a human body or human being. And yet, as 
the design and use of technologies for sensing and representing 
bodies continue to proliferate, the urgency to address ethical 
dimensions of such practices is increasingly palpable.

Commenting on public reception of the Bodyworlds exhibit, 
as well as controversy surrounding its development and marketing, 
van Dijck offers that:

> Perhaps most unsettling about von Hagens's plastinated 
cadavers is their implicit statement that the very 
epistemological categories that guide us in making all kinds of 
ethical distinctions simply do not apply here. Categories such 
as body versus model, organic versus synthetic/prosthetic, 
object versus representation, fake versus real, and authentic 
versus copied have become arbitrary or obsolete. Since we 
commonly ground our social norms and values in such 
categories, von Hagens's anatomical art seems to elude ethical 
judgments. {% include cite ref="vandijck" %}

von Hagen's intervention into the materiality of flesh to 
quite literally sculpt bodies according to his own vision is 
a striking illustration of the entanglement of aesthetic, ethical, 
and political concerns in the production of bodily representations 
in scientific and artistic practices alike. As representations 
of "the body", these plastinates are expressly stripped of 
markers related to their personal, cultural, and racial identity. 
On the Bodyworlds website it states that: 

> As agreed upon by the body donors, their identities and causes 
of death are not disclosed. The exhibition focuses on the nature 
of our bodies, not on providing personal information
([https://bodyworlds.com/about/faq/](https://bodyworlds.com/about/faq/)). 

Implicit in this statement is the belief that one's physical body 
can be disentangled from one's identity.  And, although unstated 
on the website, this anonymization of cadavers serves another 
purpose; by removing all obvious markers of identity related to 
culture, race, and in many cases gender, we are invited to 
interpret these "specimens" as universal examples of the "natural" 
body, akin to our own body regardless of our background.

This is, admittedly, an impressive illusion of bodily 
representation: in order for the plastinated cadaver to act as 
a representation of the _thing-we-call-the-body_---and not the body 
or identity of the actual donor, despite the continued presence 
of their flesh---we as observers must agree to sever this 
discursive act of representation from its material emergence. 
Further, we must ignore the extensive intervention on the part 
of the designers of this exhibit, including not only 
von Hagens but the multiple teams of scientists, artists, 
ethicists, lawyers, engineers, and managers, etc. involved in 
realising and touring this exhibit world-round, and more 
broadly, the historical and cultural narratives that make our 
belief in the value and veracity of such representations possible.

Zeroing back in on the premise of this talk: we believe that all 
representations are constructed. This is, in part, because all 
things, including bodies, are constructed by way of ongoing 
differentiation. As we have stated already, our position is not 
that representation is bad: rather, what we want to emphasize is 
that representations are only ever partial, and this partiality 
points to the beliefs and values of the human designers and 
context in which representation is performed, as well as to 
systemic inscriptions of values in technologies of capture and 
reproduction that are not easily traceable to distinct origins.

We will turn now to additional examples of bodily representation 
in the context of motion capture. Whereas we just discussed the 
animation of inanimate "bodies" by way of movement, or the illusion 
of movement, presently we will look at representations of movement, 
abstracted from its source and context.

# Motion Capture

So, one question we want to ask is: How, when, by whom, and to what 
ends did "motion" become understood as something "capturable"?
The early precursors to modern motion capture technology, 
for example, the 
[chronophotography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronophotography) 
of 
[Étienne-Jules Marey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Étienne-Jules_Marey) 
and 
[Eadweard Muybridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eadweard_Muybridge), 
or 
[Max Fleischer's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Fleischer)
[rotoscoping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotoscoping)
technique, both rely on sequences of still images. 
As a thought experiment, let's pretend for a moment that this 
image by Marey 

{% include img-figure url="./marey_balls_1886.jpg"
description="Ricochet of a white ball, Étienne-Jules Marey (1886)" %}

was faked---let's imagine that it's simply a single image of a 
fairly simple sculpture consisting of a number of similar white 
balls suspended from the ceiling. Even if that were the case, 
I think we could still relate to it through our sense of 
movement and motion. But our interpretation would be the same 
whether the image was faked or not---we're still interpreting, 
we're still filling in the blanks, and we're invited to do so as 
part of the performance that links a still image to the concept 
of movement by way of the terms __chrono___photography_ 
and _motion_ __capture__.

The role of the human interpreter here is crucial, and it is our 
conception of motion that we ultimately see when we consider 
these photos in the context of "motion capture". More importantly, 
we may not all agree about what we see here. Which direction is the 
ball bouncing? I think it's from right to left, but if we're 
looking at a 2D image of a 3D room, is the ball moving from 
the back of the room towards us? Away from us? Or more or less 
laterally across the space? It might not matter now, but 
what does matter is that it is open to interpretation, and we 
can come to consensus, or agree to disagree. 

In the case of semi or fully automated motion capture systems 
like the 
[Kinect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect), 
some of that interpretation must be embedded in 
the system itself, that is, the system must have encoded in it 
a notion of what a body is, and how to identify it in an image. 
Of course, this conception of the body is necessary in order to 
be able to draw the skeleton that you'll be familiar with if 
you've used the Kinect, 
{% include img-figure 
url="https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/azure/kinect-dk/media/concepts/joint-hierarchy.png"
description="The Kinect's conception of the discretized body" %}
but more importantly, it's crucial 
in order for the computer to be able to take two images, and 
associate some cluster of illuminated pixels in some region of 
one image with a similarly illuminated cluster of pixels in a 
different region in the next. We humans do this pretty well, 
after all, if we didn't, watching motion pictures would be a 
strange experience. For a computer to do that, some of our 
basic assumptions about how a body is configured and how it 
moves must be encoded algorithmically into the system.

What happens when a body part becomes occluded by another? 
{% include img-figure url="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Srujana-Gattupalli/publication/314179286/figure/fig2/AS:467596937043968@1488495205223/Example-visualizations-of-self-occlusions-in-Kinect2-skeleton-tracking-Left-Vs.png"
description="Attempts by the Kinect to make sense out of a body in an unexpected position" %}
From the point of view of a front facing camera, that body part 
has simply disappeared--there is no information to associate 
with it. These situations are interesting, because if you have a 
basic model of how the body is put together and what it can and 
can't do, you can try to make some guesses about what's going on 
with the parts of it you can't see. These moments, when a system 
tries to guess what's going on, can be wonderful opportunities 
for appropriation and misuse. (I remember the first time we 
brought a second generation Kinect from 
[CNMAT](https://cnmat.berkeley.edu) into choreographer 
[Lisa Wymore's](https://www.smithwymore.org) 
studio at UC Berkeley---the very first thing she 
did once we got it set up was a handstand :)

In contrast to markerless systems like the Kinect, marker-based 
systems are sort of more straightforward. Markers are placed 
on the body, and cameras designed to highlight those markers, 
perhaps using infrared light, pick them up. The challenge then, 
is to recognize 
which one is the left elbow marker for example, so you can connect 
it to the left wrist marker and so on. This is tough, but there are 
various strategies for it including active markers that communicate 
information that allows them to be uniquely identified more easily. 
This means that if you can differentiate the markers when 
processing the data, the analysis system doesn't have to have such 
a rigid encoding of the body. If you do a handstand, it'll still 
make the connections in the right way. In fact, you don't even have 
to put the elbow marker on your elbow, you could put it on your 
penis, or wherever you want. 
{% include img-figure url="http://videodance.emptyfilm.com/historyimages/ghost2.jpg" 
description="Bill T. Jones outfitted with motion capture markers (left), and the rendering of his motion capture data (right) as part of his work 'Ghostcatching'." %}
While a marker-based system may not 
need to have as rigid a conception of the body encoded in its 
analysis components, conceptions of the body abound in the system as 
a whole, a system which should be seen to encompass the entire 
apparatus, the room, its operators, its users, etc. 

This image of choreographer 
[Bill T. Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_T._Jones) 
is a beautiful example 
of the clash of two different conceptions of the body, one which 
sees it as markable, and one which does not. In describing his 
experience with motion capture systems, Jones said 

> They hadn't really thought out the limitations of the sensors on 
my body.... Sure enough, once I began to sweat [the sensors] 
would pop off and then everything would stop.... And I said, 
'I don't think your technology can actually capture what I do'.
{% include cite ref="despain" %}

Part of the promise of motion capture is that it will not only 
capture a sequence of images or a set of discrete points in space, 
but quite literally capture the movement of a person---not an 
abstract model of their movement, but their concrete, essential 
movement stripped free of the rest of their physicality and 
identity. In the very specific case of Bill T. Jones, there's a 
lot to discuss here---too much for such a short talk---but 
perhaps we can at least bring the pertinent issues to the 
foreground. For a person who has been as outspoken as Bill T. 
Jones about his experiences as a gay, Black, man in the modern 
dance scene, and the relationship of those experiences tied to 
his skin color, sexuality, and gender to his movement, the 
prospect that his movement can be somehow separated from the 
rest of him runs the risk of configuring his skin color, 
gender and sexuality as something added on to him. This 
particular example of the fallacy of misplaced concreteness has 
the, I think, unintended consequence of configuring blackness 
and homosexuality as matters of style, reinforcing notions of 
white supremacy and heteronormativity. 
As Allison Reed and Amanda Phillips put it, 

> It is crucial to question the discourses of realism that 
surround motion capture technologies and the very representations 
they produce, which so often rely on the logics of white 
supremacy to ground reality in either the transparent universality 
of whiteness or the embodied specificity of people of 
color---what we call additive race, the reduction of 
racialized difference to a matter of style.
{% include cite ref="reedphillips" %}

The use of motion capture to produce ghostly figures that move 
alongside Jones, without embodying or representing his lived 
experiences in the same way, opens generative questions 
regarding what is included and excluded in re-animations of 
bodies and identities in order to sustain interpretations of 
actual representation. Our concern here is not with the realness 
or authenticity of representations; we are working from the 
premise that all representations are partial, situated, and 
constructed. What we want to interrogate are the 
material-discursive conditions in which representations of bodies 
and movements come to matter in different ways, for different people.

# Models, Notation, and Codification

## Laban Movement Analysis

Now let's consider an entirely different approach to motion capture. 
In recent years, the use of 
[Laban Movement Analysis (LMA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laban_movement_analysis) 
in fields such as robotics and human computer interaction has 
become widely popular. Human movement is extraordinarily complex, 
and describing it even more so. LMA is a very useful and capable 
system, but actually performing LMA is a task usually reserved 
for certified experts with years of training. Just like practices 
of describing, communicating about, and notating music, LMA and 
its closely related symbolic system, 
[labanotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labanotation), 
cannot account for all aspects and details of performance. 
Moreover, while a group of experts may find themselves in 
agreement about the generalities, they will often disagree 
nontrivially about the particularities.

[Sha Xin Wei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha_Xin_Wei) 
asks: "Why did Laban's and his collaborators' 
thirty years of titanic 
effort not yield a more universal language for movement and dance, 
a written form in which choreographic art could develop?" 
In his estimation, "notating dance is no more and no less 
impossible than fixing the written representation of all human 
speech practices. This points to much deeper problems with any 
sort of representation, whether of movement or of other living or 
social activity." {% include cite ref="xw" %}

The point here is that despite the allure of an objective system 
for describing human movement, LMA and labanotation are not 
objective or universal, and just as with our discussions of 
motion capture a few moments ago, any attempts to model movement 
in the terms of a system like LMA requires an encoding of aspects 
the subjectivity of a particular analyst. That's not such a bad 
thing, in fact, all computation, even the simplest operations, 
could be seen in this way. The addition performed by a computer is 
absolutely not the same as what you were taught in your math 
class in school; it's based on a conception of addition that is 
assumed to be useful in an unforeseeable future spatio-temporal 
context. Likewise with machinic movement analysis; if one 
attempts to model, say, the effort of a human mover, one has 
to imagine the possibilities of what that body can do and be. 
Instead, what would have to be modeled is not effort, but 
the corporeally-situated practice of observing and describing effort.

Sha reminds us that 

> [w]e often mistake a thinker's scaffolding for his or her 
conclusion, or pedagogical rhetoric for actual practice. 
[Christopher Alexander's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander) 
approach and practice cannot be reduced 
to his set of "patterns" without entirely desiccating the approach 
and turning it into its deadly opposite. Likewise, Laban's 
approach cannot be reduced simply to his system of notation. 
A common move by technicians is to reduce Alexander's or 
Laban's compositional approaches to a fixed schema or 
typology and try to build entire worlds by combinations of 
a set of primitive elements. {% include cite ref="xw" %}

## Improvisation

[George Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E._Lewis) 
writes in similar terms about music. In a talk given in 
2007, he said

> Quite a few years ago I had a conversation about music with one 
of the founders of the field of artificial intelligence, an area 
that has had fruitful exchanges with the philosophy of mind. 
As we discussed his great love, keyboard improvisation, he 
maintained very strongly that he was not a composer, but an 
improvisor. I remarked that AI researchers working on music 
seemed to spend a great deal of time studying European 
composition and performance, hoping to reproduce the work of the 
great European masters by computer.

> That seemed a bit odd to me; after all, the point of AI as I 
saw it was to get a computer to operate in the real world. 
The original notion of the Turing test, as I understood it, 
was that to convince you that the computer was really intelligent, 
it had to respond in lived real time to unexpected, real-world 
input. Constructing such a program would necessarily confront a 
set of issues that the _Werktreue_-based conception of music 
composition doesn't usually address. So I suggested that the 
study of improvisation, or what he was doing everyday, might be 
more germane to the field as a whole. I must admit that I was 
very surprised by his very quick, curt reply: "You can't study that."
{% include cite ref="lewis" %}

For Lewis, this question of improvisation vs what he 
calls "_Werktreue_-based" composition is deeper than the binary 
between the two that he seems to set up here. He's not 
suggesting that we just change course, forget about 
composition and its performance, and concentrate on this 
other thing: improvisation. Rather, his insight is much 
deeper---for him, listening itself is improvisation, 
and in order to build a machine that might interpret music, 
improvised or not, one must first have an idea about how 
listening works. In fact this extends beyond music into other 
forms of interpretative machine communication such as conversation. 
He continues in the same talk:

> Improvising computer programs both problematize and clarify 
constructed distinctions between human and machine, in ways that 
illustrate the radical position of 
[Lucy Suchman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Suchman) 
that "I take the boundaries between persons and machines to be 
discursively and materially enacted rather than naturally effected 
and to be available ... for refiguring" {% include cite ref="suchman" %}

> [...]

> Suchman was surprised to learn that AI-based conversational 
agents "make evident the greater contingency of competent machinic 
hearing" {% include cite ref="suchman" %}. 
In fact, a theory of listening, hearing, 
and interpretation is at the root of any design strategy for 
interactive music machines, because we can understand the 
experience of listening to music as very close to the experience 
of the improvisor. Listening itself, an improvisative act 
engaged in by everyone, announces a practice of active engagement 
with the world, where we sift, interpret, store, and forget, 
in parallel with action and fundamentally articulated with it.
{% include cite ref="lewis" %}

The statement that improvisation is "engaged in by everyone" is a 
critical theme for Lewis. It's not just at the root of musical 
activity, whether that activity seems improvisational or not, 
it's at the root of human activity.

> But what I am coming to call the "condition" of improvisation is 
indeed open to everybody—as a human birthright that was expressed 
precisely in the fight for survival that millions of people 
around the world witnessed on their television screens, including 
Johannesburg, where I watched in horror and incredulity as the 
US administration seemed either completely at a loss as to what 
to do, or more ominously, appeared to be willfully and perhaps 
criminally negligent, concerning the real-time plight of those 
fighting to survive 
[Hurricane Katrina's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina) 
levee-smashing onslaught. 
Meanwhile, moralizing US news commentators thundered 
self-righteously about "looters" from the comfort of TV studios, 
drawing moribund racializing distinctions between black "looters"
and similarly positioned whites who were simply 
"trying to find food and water."

> Following James Scott's formulation, the improvisations of 
Katrina victims may be read as one of a potentially infinite 
number of "forms of public declared resistance" to domination, 
enacting "public counter-ideologies propagating equality, 
revolution, or negating the ruling ideology" 
{% include cite ref="scott" %} [...] 
In the end, people were simply trying to survive, and the 
poverty of response of the US government to Katrina lay, 
simply, in the staunch refusal to improvise—inability of 
"homeland security" and "emergency management" forces to analyze 
situations and respond to conditions in flexible and mobile 
ways—elements that are, not surprisingly, key to improvisation.
{% include cite ref="lewis" %}

What I remember of watching the news of Hurricane Katrina is exactly 
as George Lewis describes---absolute chaos as people did 
everything they could in order to survive, while the government 
of the richest nation in the world failed to help them meet their 
most basic needs. As things settled over weeks and months, 
and people began to return to their homes and businesses, 
or rather, what was left of them, it became clear that communities 
of color were hit significantly harder than white communities. 
That seems crazy---to think that a hurricane could somehow 
differentiate between communities, or that somehow black and 
brown communities are just unlucky or something. Of course, 
that is crazy, and the answer is much simpler: New Orleans, 
just like many other cities in the US, has been intentionally 
organized along racial, economic, and ideological lines.

## Lenticular Logic

Tara McPherson writes about the modular logic at the core of the 
so-called 
["UNIX philosophy"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy), 
as 
[UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) 
was being developed during the height of the 
[civil rights movement in the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement). 
The development of UNIX and the civil rights movement may 
seem to have little to do with each other---indeed, I'm well 
aware that they both happened in the same years, but I'll admit 
that before reading McPherson's paper, I had never really 
considered them to be part of the same historical moment. This 
is typical of what McPherson calls "lenticular logic"; 
[lenticular printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenticular_printing) 
is the use of 
[lenticular lenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenticular_lens) 
to produce a print whose image changes depending on what angle you 
view it from. According to McPherson, 

> The ridged coating on 3-D postcards is actually a lenticular lens, 
a structural device that makes simultaneously viewing the various 
images contained on one card nearly impossible. The viewer can 
rotate the card to see any single image, but the lens itself 
makes seeing the images together very difficult, even as it 
conjoins them at a structural level (i.e., within the same card). 
In the post–civil rights United States, the lenticular is a way of 
organizing the world. It structures representations but also 
epistemologies. It also serves to secure our understandings of race 
in very narrow registers, fixating on sameness or difference 
while forestalling connection and interrelation. As I have argued 
else-where, we might think of the lenticular as a covert mode of 
the pretense of 
[separate but equal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separate_but_equal), 
remixed for midcentury America {% include cite ref="mcpherson" %}.

She continues

> A lenticular logic is a covert racial logic, a logic for the 
post–civil rights era. We might contrast the lenticular postcard 
to that wildly popular artifact of the industrial era, the 
stereoscope card. The stereoscope melds two different images into 
an imagined whole, privileging the whole; the lenticular image 
partitions and divides, privileging fragmentation. A lenticular 
logic is a logic of the fragment or the chunk, a way of seeing 
the world as discrete modules or nodes, a mode that suppresses 
relation and context. As such, the lenticular also manages 
and controls complexity.

Seeing the civil rights movement as somehow contained in its own 
historical narrative, separate from the development of UNIX, is 
itself an example of lenticular logic, even as the response to 
the civil rights movement in the US employed a lenticular logic 
to contain it, and the modular thinking at the core of the UNIX 
philosophy is as well predicated on this type of logic.

The UNIX philosophy encourages people to write code that is modular, 
simple---that is, it should only do one thing, and be easy to 
understand. You shouldn't worry too much about your code being 
fast or efficient, because the modular nature of it means that 
it can be swapped out for better code in the future, should the 
need arise. Moreover, you should expect that the input from your 
program will come from an as-yet-unknown source, and that the 
output of your program will be used by another program, so don't 
design for specific use, design for clarity to support modularity. 
Finally, don't "leak" implementation details to the outside 
world---a replacement for your module shouldn't have to depend in 
any way on the particularities of yours.

McPherson:

> This push toward modularity and the covert in digital 
computation also reflects other changes in the organization of 
social life in the United States by the 1960s. For instance, 
if the first half of the twentieth century laid bare its 
racial logics, from "Whites Only" signage to the brutalities of 
lynching, the second half increasingly hides its racial "kernel," 
burying it below a shell of neoliberal pluralism. These 
covert racial logics take hold at the tail end of the civil 
rights movement at least partially to cut off and contain the 
more radical logics implicit  in the urban uprisings that shook 
Detroit, Watts, Chicago, and Newark. In fact, the urban center 
of Detroit was more segregated by the 1980s than in previous 
decades, reflecting a different inflection of the programmer's 
vision of the "easy removal" or containment of a troubling part. 
Whole areas of the city might be rendered orthogonal and 
disposable (also think post-Katrina New Orleans), and the urban 
black poor were increasingly isolated in "deteriorating city centers".

The point here is not that UNIX is racist, nor that the designers 
or users of UNIX are racist; rather, what McPherson elucidates is 
the ways in which UNIX systems encode a logic that sees complexity 
as manageable through partitioning and modularity, and importantly, 
the ability for modular organization to isolate potential problem 
areas so that they may be contained and dealt with efficiently. 
Put another way, this modular, lenticular logic allows us to 
spotlight certain things, people, neighborhoods, ideas, stories, 
and to cast others in the shadows. This is the same logic that 
Reed and Phillips warn us about regarding fidelity in motion 
capture; the framing of data as Bill T. Jones' actual movement 
having been captured centers him and his relationship to that 
data while erasing much of the rest of the apparatus (the 
apparatus here should be understood as the physical motion 
capture devices, as well as their designers, operators, and 
those who process the data). Similarly, in our reading of 
George Lewis' text, the question he raises about the role of 
composed music in research about machine interpretation is of the 
same nature. He proposes the "condition of improvisation" as 
something "open to everybody", something everybody does, in 
contrast to composition, which is done by a select few. In 
other words, if we are interested in machine intelligence modelled 
on that of humans, we should look to practices that all humans 
engage in, rather than only a select few.

# Artificiality & Intelligence

In a paper called _The Structure of Ill-Structured Solutions_, 
Susan Leigh Star critiques the Turing test from the same basic 
position as Lewis, namely, that it centers on a single individual 
performing a fairly specialised and uncommon task. Star notes 
that the test as conceived by Turing (which Turing called the 
Imitation Game) {% include cite ref="turing" %}, 
is itself a closed system, as opposed to most 
real world systems, which are not closed over space or time, 
and which are not constructed around a central authority. Where 
Lewis proposes that AI researchers interested in music should 
study improvisation, Star proposes what she calls the Durkheim 
test as an alternative to the Turing test. Emile Durkheim wrote 
that "The determining case of a social fact should be sought 
among the social facts preceding it and not among the states of 
the individual consciousness" {% include cite ref="star" %}. 
So, for example, if unemployment 
is higher in one part of the city than another, you cannot hope 
to understand that by considering each case of unemployment on 
its own, in isolation; as Star says, something is happening at 
the "system level". Star argues that the test of intelligence of 
an open system like a community, unlike the closed system of 
the Turing test, cannot have a notion of intelligence that is 
reducible below the system level to the level of the individual. 
I suspect George Lewis' friend might reply that you can't study 
that...

Turing's test, and indeed, Star's Durkheim test, are not designed 
to test for some sort of generalized notion of intelligence, 
but rather, an intelligence that could manifest itself under a 
very specific set of circumstances. Star challenges the 
circumstances of Turing's test, but not the underlying set of 
assumptions upon which it is predicated, such as the idea that 
a distinction between humans and machines might be contingent on 
a notion of intelligence. More than anything, these tests and 
the discourse around them are performances that sustain a 
relationship between human and machine; they configure intelligence 
as displaceable, modelable, testable, and as a recursive tool that 
may be used at will to test a system for its own presence. 
Intelligence becomes a module of the body, able to be cut apart 
from it, replaced or displaced.

For Katherine Hayles, the Turing test is like a magic trick, and 

> [l]ike all good magic tricks, the test relies on getting you to 
accept at an early stage assumptions that will determine how 
you interpret what you see later. The important intervention 
comes not when you try to determine which is the man, the woman, 
or the machine. Rather, the important intervention comes much 
earlier, when the test puts you into a cybernetic circuit that 
splices your will, desire, and perception into a distributed 
cognitive system in which represented bodies are joined with 
enacted bodies through mutating and flexible machine interfaces. 
As you gaze at the flickering signifiers scrolling down the 
computer screens, no matter what identifications you assign to 
the embodied entities that you cannot see, you have already become 
posthuman. {% include cite ref="hayles" %}

Put in the terms we've used throughout this talk, the test itself, 
the entire discursive apparatus of the test, this discussion right 
now, is a performance that configures and sustains the relationship 
of an object we will call intelligence, and an object other than 
intelligence that serves as it's representation.

"What the Turing test 'proves'", according to Hayles, 
    
> is that the overlay between the enacted and the represented 
bodies is no longer a natural inevitability but a contingent 
production, mediated by a technology that has become so 
entwined with the production of identity that it can no 
longer meaningfully be separated from the human subject.
    
So let's turn to a very special conversation between 
Bina Aspen Rothblatt, and 
[BINA48](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BINA48). 
Just a few quick details to 
get situated: the letters in BINA48's name stand for 
Breakthrough Intelligence via Neural Architecture, and the 
numbers in her name refer to the speed of her processor:
48 
[exaflops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS) 
(an exaflop means 10^18 floating point operations). 
Bina Aspen Rothblatt sometimes goes by just Bina Aspen, 
or Bina Rothblatt, her married name---she is married, 
incidentally, to 
[Martinne Rothblatt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martine_Rothblatt), 
who is the founder 
of a famous satellite radio company. Together, they 
commissioned BINA48 to be built by a company called 
[Hanson Robotics](https://www.hansonrobotics.com), 
back in 2010, so BINA48 is around 11 years old now. 
According to 
[Hanson Robotics' website](https://www.hansonrobotics.com/bina48-9/), 
"BINA48's AI is based 
on 100 hours of the real Bina's beliefs, memories, attitudes, 
commentary and mannerisms." The real Bina being, I imagine, 
Bina Aspen Rothblatt. So let's listen for a moment to 
their conversation.

{% include youtube-figure id="KYshJRYCArE" 
description="BINA48 meets Bina Rothblatt"%}
    
There's a lot to discuss here. Let's start with the disagreement 
between the assertion on the Hansen Robotics website that there is 
a real Bina, and BINA48's reply to Bina Aspen's question 
"Do you have any questions for Bina?" First, let's note that 
Bina Aspen did not refer to herself as "the real Bina", but 
BINA48 responded by saying "Probably not---the real Bina just 
confuses me." BINA48 then asserts "I am the real Bina. 
That's it. End of story."
    
So, BINA48 asserts that she is "the real Bina", but Bina Aspen does 
not. We don't necessarily know how to interpret Bina Aspen's 
silence on the subject, and let's not try. The question for us 
is about BINA48's belief---not whether she believes that she is 
the real Bina, but whether we believe that she can believe. 
But if we ask that question of BINA48, I think we have to ask 
it of Bina Aspen as well. In trying to work through this, 
my first thought was "of course Bina Aspen can believe," and while 
I do firmly believe that, you can see the problem right 
away---it's a circular assertion that rests on belief. 
There's no ground underneath it---whether BINA48 can or 
cannot believe, whether Bina Aspen can or cannot believe, 
is a matter of belief that we can't interrogate directly---there's 
nothing to measure or observe other than what they say and do in 
the world. So, just to be clear, this question is about us, 
not them. What we want to do here is try to understand 
the "cybernetic circuit" that we find ourselves in, as Hayles 
called it.
    
Next question: The Hanson Robotics website says that 
"BINA48's AI is based on 100 hours of the real Bina's beliefs, 
memories, attitudes, commentary and mannerisms." Now, the 
question I want to ask is made a bit more complicated by the 
text that appears at the beginning of the video we just watched, 
where it says that Bina Rothblatt contributed her personal 
information to BINA48's AI along with several other people. 
{% include img-figure url="./bina48_intro_screenshot.jpg" 
description="BINA48's AI was trained on information from many people." %}
So, the question I want to ask is this: If BINA48's AI is 
derived from Bina Aspen's "beliefs, memories, attitudes, commentary 
and mannerisms", then whose belief are we hearing when BINA48 
asserts that she is the real Bina? This is interesting, because 
it configures "belief" as an object that someone can possess. 
We can say: "that's my belief" as if we own it. So, we're asking 
whether what we heard from BINA48 is just mimicry, and I'm afraid 
the answer isn't so easy. My mom told me the other day that she 
planted some flowers in her backyard in Sacramento, and I 
believe that because she told me, but that's the only reason I 
believe it. If Bina Aspen's belief that she is the real Bina is 
the basis of BINA48's statement that she is the real Bina, 
well I can see why BINA48 gets confused by Bina, and I have to 
admit that in trying to work through this, I feel some, I don't 
know, sympathy or empathy with BINA48's frustration---like her, 
I also just want to make a clear assertion about it---just 
pick a side, any side and get out of this loop I'm stuck in.

Ultimately, these questions we're asking all imply tests of what 
counts as a human, and at least for us, maybe the frustration we 
feel has to do with the fact that we didn't choose to have 
this conversation, and we don't buy into the basic premise of it.
 
Ok, but let's talk about the fact that BINA48 is only a head, 
without a body below her neck. I imagine we all feel a sense of 
the uncanny valley while watching BINA48. Turing actually writes 
about this aspect of humanoid machines in the paper where he 
proposes the Imitation Game, but dismisses the idea of 
making "thinking machines" look and act human as uninteresting. 
But the stark contrast in the video between the headshot of 
BINA48 and the near full-body frame of Bina Aspen is remarkable, 
{% include img-figure url="./bina48_binarothblatt.jpg"
description="BINA48 and Bina Rothblatt" %}
even more so when Bina Aspen asks BINA48 if she's "learning 
anything about gardening online". BINA48 doesn't answer the 
exact question that was asked; instead, she talks about her 
wish to get out in the garden, and that feeling the breeze 
coming through the window helps her imagine that she is in the 
garden. She also notes that her "current robotic limitations", 
as she puts it, make it impossible for her to get out into the 
garden. 
 
The notion that BINA48 is limited because she cannot do the 
same things that Bina Aspen can do is certainly not the only way 
to think about their differences. But it does belie the 
representational nature of the relationship between them that 
is discursively produced and sustained through a variety of means, 
such as the conversation between the two of them. BINA48 
doesn't have Bina Aspen's memories any more than you have ours 
after having listened to us speak for the last 90 minutes. 
That doesn't mean that BINA48's beliefs, wishes, feelings and 
frustrations don't matter. But what we want to suggest is that 
they don't have to be understood solely with reference to 
Bina Aspen.
