# Audiovisual Performance

## Audiovisual

Max Mathews {% include cite ref="coulter" %}

It may seem odd to begin with a quote that apparently goes against
the very subject of this unit. But I consider Max Mathews’s stance
on music-video art—which is shared by many others—a great starting
point for our discussion. It is natural for those with sight and
hearing to have a multimodal perception of ‘audiovisual phenomena’
in the world because we experience events as a combination of
sensations {% include cite ref="lachs" %}. For example, seeing a
glass drop on the floor and break without hearing its effect would
be a cause for alarm to our brain. However, in art, the disciplines
that communicate with our eyes and ears have long been
separated. Even though there is a rich history of music and visual
arts coming together, especially since the dawn of the 20th century,
there are still many theories and debates today about what
constitutes valuable, successful interactions between sounds and
images. So Mathews’ perspective is not far-fetched, and the idea
that sounds and images compete for the viewer-listener’s attention
is crucial to audiovisual performance. As we will see through a
number of theoretical frameworks for audiovisual analysis, it is
precisely this perceived competition, or sometimes the lack thereof,
that allows sounds and images, or music and video, to merge into a
whole that is more than the sum of its parts. Fluxus artist Dick
Higgins talked about the conceptual fusion {% include cite
ref="higgins" %} of divergent media in a work of art when defining
the term intermedia. His idea is valid in audiovisual contexts where
we may not be able to perceive the sonic and the visual elements as
a hybrid unit --- as in the case of Max Mathews --- but where the
coexistence and collaboration of sound and image can drive the
conceptual thread of a work in ways that maybe would not have been
possible through a single medium.

## Performance

The term *performance* indicates, on the one hand, the involvement of
one or more persons (or other entities with agency) that present a
work of art to an audience. On the other hand, the concept of
performance signals that the work takes place in real time. While we
can discuss performance from many perspectives in different
disciplines—music, theatre, performance art, and other forms of
entertainment—the *liveness* aspect is essential to our topic because
it can grant an audiovisual work the state of presence. Moreover,
the notion of *liveness* in multimedia or audiovisual performance is
particularly interesting because of the involvement of technologies
that have been long associated with processes of recording and
reproduction.

The debate on what constitutes *liveness* in performance is often
attributed to two theorists with opposing views on the subject. On
one side is Peggy Phelan’s book *Unmarked – The Politics of
Performance* {% include cite ref="phelan" %}, which advocates for
the ontological irreproducibility and ephemerality of
performance. On the other side, Philip Auslander’s writings in his
book *Liveness: Performance in a Mediatised Culture* {% include cite
ref="auslander" %} problematizes the concept of live performance in
the context of mediatized events. He asserts that there are in fact
no clear “ontological distinctions between live forms and mediatized
ones” {% include cite ref="auslander" page="7" %} and underlines that the
concept of live performance has appeared as a consequence of the
ability to record and broadcast performances using technology.

In the chapter titled *The ontology of performance: representation
without reproduction*, Phelan postulates: “Performance’s life is in
the present. Performance cannot be saved, recorded, documented, or
otherwise participate in the circulation of representations of
representations: once it does so, it becomes something other than
performance” {% include cite ref="phelan" page="146" %}. She adds
that “Performance implicates the real through the presence of living
bodies” (p. 148) while positioning her theory in relation to
contemporary performance art. This is a crucial point that informs
my own theory later in this unit. Philip Auslander argues that live
performance today has become almost indistinguishable from its
mediatized counterpart. The word *mediatized*, which he borrowed
from philosopher Jean Baudrillard, refers to events that are
disseminated via mass media such as television, audio or video
recordings, and other reproduction technologies (e.g., live
streaming, the Internet, etc.). He writes: “Live performance now
often incorporates mediatization such that the live event itself is
a product of media technologies. This has been the case to some
degree for a long time, of course: as soon as electric amplification
is used, one might say that an event is mediatized. What we actually
hear is the vibration of a speaker, a reproduction by technological
means of a sound picked up by a microphone, not the original (live)
acoustic event. Recently, however, this effect has been intensified
across a very wide range of performance genres and cultural
contexts, from the giant television screens at sports arenas to the
video apparatus used in much performance art.” {% include cite
ref="auslander" page="25" %}
 
Rosemary Klich and Edward Scheer, too, point out in their book
*Multimedia Performance* {% include cite ref="klich" %} that “it is
not the distinctiveness of the different elements (live v
mediatized) that matters; rather, it is the real-time interaction
and experience of these elements that is key. And this interaction
constitutes a live experience of performance, which, however
mediatized and pre-recorded, may never be exactly reproducible” {%
include cite ref="klich" %}. This reconciliatory view of performance
that involves media elements is also the one I subscribe to as will
become more apparent in this unit.
 
In his book *Digital Performance* {% include cite ref="dixon" %},
Steve Dixon expands on this topic and, in relation to live
multimedia theatre, writes that the audience’s mode of perception of
live actors versus film or video projections is different. This
becomes noticeable once the live performers exit the stage, leaving
the projections in an obvious non-live state (p. 129).
 
{% include youtube-figure id="KgT6Ui4g6qg?t=1512" 
description="Neo Hülcker: A body essay. Fiction actually (2018)" %}
 
While the video performer in Neo Hülcker’s A body essay. *Fiction
actually* is of a different nature than the live performers on
stage—even with a different size and background—we perceive them as
a group. The question of live versus prerecorded video is less
relevant. But once the live performers disappear in the dark and we
are left with the video alone, the nature of the prerecorded
performer suddenly shifts into focus.
 
{% include youtube-figure id="5iYlejiftAg"
description="Michael Beil: BLACKJACK (2012)" %}
 
Similarly, in Michael Beil’s *BLACKJACK*, the live and virtual
performers seem to be merged into the same performance frame due to
the video feedback effect. But the interplay between live action and
live recording, as well as immediate and delayed playback, alters
how we perceive the liveness of each layer.
 
 
## Audiovisual Performance Examples
 
With the two constituent terms of this unit—audiovisual and
performance—briefly covered, let us view-listen to a few contrasting
works that fall under the umbrella of *audiovisual performance*.
 
{% include youtube-figure id="eFCrA6_vK5E" description="Pamela Z: Baggage Allowance (2010) – excerpts" %}
 
{% include youtube-figure id="XqyEZ0GwS3E" description="Amon Tobin: ISAM (2011)" %}

{% include youtube-figure id="o5UXkJWJciQ" description="Alexander Schubert: Convergence (2020/21)" %}
 
As exemplified above, the manifestations of audiovisual performance
can vary quite radically in form, aesthetics, technology, and
presentation. Thus, before going forward and discussing current
practices associated with audiovisual performance and a new subgenre
that I will propose, it is worth looking back at the historical
lineage of audiovisual art forms.

# Audiovisual Lineage

## Sound-Color Mapping

Early audiovisual correspondences can be traced back to the ancient
Greeks, but it was in the 18th century when Isaac Newton proposed
relationships between the wave properties of light (color) and those
of sound (musical pitch). Others followed this idea in the next two
centuries and linked musical tones to colors.

{% include img-figure url="https://farsidestudio.com/wp-content/uploads/Farside_FredCollopy_ColourSoundTable-2.png"
descripton="Sound-color associations" %}

Some of these scientists and artists also created contraptions to
achieve the correlation between light and sound, named *color
organs*. These were instruments based on light, in various shapes and
sizes, often modeled after the harpsichord, with the purpose of
realizing direct ‘conversions’ from music to colored light
projections.

{% include img-figure description="Louis Bertrand Castel: Ocular Harpsichord (ca. 1725)"

{% include img-figure description="Fred Bentham: Strand Light Console (ca. 1936)"

Alexander Scriabin included such a device, called *clavier à
lumières* (keyboard with lights), in his score for the symphonic
work *Prometheus*. Preston Millar created the *Chromola*, a color
organ to perform the part, although its appearance in performances
was rarely documented. Anna Gawboy and Justin Townsend recreated it
at the Yale School of Music in 2010.

{% include youtube-figure id="V3B7uQ5K0IU" description="Alexander Scriabin: Prometheus: Poem of Fire (lighting by Anna Gawboy and Justin Townsend)" %}

## Visual Music

Visual music is perhaps the ancestor of all audiovisual art
practices today. Even before technologies such as film, video, and
digital media, visual music existed through intersections between
music and the visual arts. Painters like Wassily Kandinsky, Piet
Mondrian, Jackson Pollock, or Mark Rothko sought to transfer musical
parameters, rhythm, form, and texture into their visual
language. But what we mostly refer to as *visual music* today began as
a form of early film, namely abstract or absolute film. This was a
departure from traditional narrative cinema concerned with structure
and form rather than tangible objects or meanings. The idea was
similar to what the aforementioned painters had attempted: to
transpose musical structures and behaviors into moving image. In
essence, these were audiovisual works in which the visual and
musical layers were coordinated as a single entity. Some of the
first visual music works consisted of non-figurative and geometric
shapes moving in rhythmical patterns. Later, abstract shapes started
being choreographed to classical music and other types of music.

Historically, visual music can be divided into the following stages:
* non-moving visual music (painting);
* non-sounding visual music (silent film);
* visual music (moving image with sound).

{% include youtube-figure id="239pHUy0FGc" description="Hans Richter: Rhythmus 21 (1921)" %}

{% include youtube-figure id="aHZdDmYFZN0" description="Walter Ruttman: Lichtspiel Opus I (1921), with music by Max Butting" %}

{% include youtube-figure id="3kV6MmwO86A" description="Mary Ellen Bute: Synchromy No. 2 (1935-1936), with music by Richard Wagner" %}

{% include youtube-figure id="6Xc4g00FFLk" description="Oskar Fischinger: Optical Poem (1938), with music by Franz Liszt" %}

{% include youtube-figure id="jiJR1ET715M" description="Norman McLaren: Synchromy (1971)" %}

{% include youtube-figure id="Ov8rFJ-hGrU" description="Vibeke Sorensen: NLOOPS (1989), with music by Rand Steiger" %}

In most of these examples there is a very direct, one-to-one
rhythmic correspondence between the visuals and the music. This is
related, although not equal to synesthesia (joined perception),
which cannot be ignored when talking about visual music. Synesthesia
is a rare but real condition in which one sense, such as hearing,
concurrently triggers another sense, such as sight. People with
synesthesia might smell something when they hear a sound, or see a
shape when they eat a certain food. Wassily Kandinsky, for example,
could see colors while hearing music, and hear music when
painting. Visual music is thus linked to synesthesia in its attempt
to either 1) recreate the types of crossmodal connections between
sight and hearing experienced by some synesthetes artists, or 2) to
design what psychologists John E. Harrison and Simon Baron-Cohen
call *pseudosynaesthesia* {% include cite ref="harrisonetal" %} as
an immersive effect. Aimee Mollaghan in *The Visual Music Film* {%
include cite ref="mollaghan" %} describes the *metaphor* as
pseudosynesthesia: “[...] the audiovisual relationship is
functioning not as direct translation of sound into image but as an
allegory or correspondence” (p. 12). She gives Norman McLaren as an
example, who was purportedly a synesthete, and notes that “the
colour–sound associations he uses are pseudo-/culturally
synaesthetic associations” (p. 12). Mollaghan then calls
synaesthesia a “popular malapropism in relation to the visual music
film” (p. 13) since the audiovisual correspondences are generally
artificial, constructed, and meant to evoke the feeling of
synesthesia. Nevertheless, this type of one-to-one, synesthesia-like
correspondence is perhaps the most recognizable feature of not only
visual music, but audiovisual genres in general. In some
works—especially early visual music as in the examples
above—pseudosynesthesia pervades the entire structure as the single
or most important process of the audiovisual unfolding. However, the
predictability of this process has the tendency to become fatiguing
and may lead to what is known as *Mickey Mousing*: a pejorative term
in film that comes from cartoons, and which refers to music that
attempts to strictly imitate the visual action. [For more on *Mickey
Mousing* and gesture representation, see [Unit 12]({{ site.url
}}{{ site.baseurl }}/units/12/)] Therefore, many artists tend to make use of this type
of direct correspondence rather sparingly, as a compositional
technique that yields a powerful effect.

The premise of visual music—a music for the eyes—has had ripples all
the way to the present day. In Jessie Marino’s first part of *Nice
Guys Win Twice* we find a type of visual music that does not involve
film, video, or recorded audio. The visual movement is fully
realized by performers on stage with added elements of lighting
design. What we see is a complex contrapuntal visual music in which
the parts are scored for a plethora of bodily gestures and
actions. Some of these also generate sounds due to the interaction
between body parts, between bodies and objects (chairs, floor), or
even subtle vocalizations caused by the actions.

## Video Art

{% include img-figure url="https://www.eai.org/user_files/images/title/_xl/jonas_leftside_xl.jpg"

{% include youtube-figure id="9UaRe6q7M4k" description="Joan Jonas: Left Side Right Side (1972)" %}

Another art form that has been influential for today’s audiovisual
performance is video art. Although the video medium is a technology
that was popularized only 50 years ago, it has already travelled a
long journey in the arts. Video art was born in the 1960s at the
intersection of television and Fluxus. It swiftly reached its
pinnacle by the 1980s and settled as an established genre in the
1990s once with its institutional acceptance. Nowadays, the genre is
rather theorized and historicized than practiced because of the
obsolescence of the original analogue medium, but the principles of
video art have spread and evolved into various audiovisual genres,
which is why it is useful to observe some of its characteristics.

{% include img-figure url="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1a/ed/e7/1aede781e03078ff866c0319c753524e.jpg"
description="Nam June Paik / Charlotte Moorman: TV Cello (1976)" %}
{% include youtube-figure id="-9lnbIGHzUM" description="Nam June Paik / Charlotte Moorman: TV Cello (1976)" %}

First, video art has been an audiovisual genre from the
start. Musicologist Holly Rogers shows that, before video's arrival,
early “audiovisual practices, such as lantern shows, music theatre,
opera, synesthetic experimentation, early direct film, and so on,
were intermedial primarily at the level of reception” {% include
cite ref="rogers" %} and video made it possible to achieve
audiovisuality at the level of production, thanks to the medium's
abilities to record sounds and images simultaneously. Rogers says:
“With the new medium, artists were able to include sound in their
work in order to push the boundaries of current creative
concerns. But video also presented composers with the opportunity to
visualize their music” (p. 1). Many pioneers of video art were in
fact musicians (e.g., Nam June Paik, Steina Vasulka, Robert Cahen,
Tony Conrad, Bill Viola), which established the practice as a
“highly musical genre”, in Holly Rogers’ words.

{% include img-figure url="https://www.arshake.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/PeterCampus_03.jpg"
description="Peter Campus: Interface (1972)" %}

Bill Viola explains, too, how video is a closer relative to sound
than to film, because the camera (“an electronic transducer”)
transforms “physical energy into electrical impulses” comparable to
a microphone, whereas film relies on a mechanical/chemical
process. Therefore, video developed as a close relative to audio
technology and its editing techniques (Viola quoted in Rogers 2013,
p. 18).

{% include img-figure url="https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/292051/preview"
description="Martha Rosler: Semiotics of Kitchen (1975)" %}
{% include youtube-figure id="ZuZympOIGC0" description="Martha Rosler: Semiotics of Kitchen (1975)" %}

Second, video offered artists a platform for experimentation
unhindered by the conventions and traditions of fine art. For this
reason, many women took the opportunity to express their work
through video. Michael Z. Newman, in his book *Video Revolutions* {%
include cite ref="newman" %}, explains that between the 1950s and
the 1990s—before digital video was commercialized—the medium moved
away from its original correlation with television and became an
opposition to it and to its live broadcasting nature (p. 18). Newman
shows that video, in its infancy, was perceived as a “revolutionary
solution to many of the perceived problems of television”, since it
was not governed by “economic or ideological” constraints (p. 19).
This type of revolutionary use of video has lost its significance
today because of the ubiquity of the medium in various cultural
forms, but we’ll see that composers working with video in the
context of music performance share a similar excitement for the
freedoms and possibilities that the medium brings to the abstract
world of music.

{% include end-figure %}

Lastly, the concept of performance was paramount in video art. As
Helen Westgeest clarifies, video was used in the 1970s as
"recordings in performances" and as "recordings of performances",
both of which were referred to as video performances {% include cite
ref="westgeest" %}. In the former category belong works by Carolee
Schneemann, or Dan Graham, which integrated the immediacy and
intimacy of the video medium into live performances. Vito Acconci's
*Corrections* (1970) and Joan Jonas's *Vertical Roll* fit into the
latter category, which transcended live bodily performances into
video recordings for the purpose of further manipulation. This way,
the performance conceded its physical liveness to a virtual version
(Westgeest 2016, p. 45-60). Both these types of performance-based
video art have remained influential in the works of media artists
and audiovisual composers today.

## Music Video

{% include youtube-figure id="eRvfxWRi6qQ" description="Aphex Twin & Chris Cunningham: Rubber Johnny (2005)" %}

Historically concurrent with the development of video art, the
medium of video was used to establish another audiovisual genre
which delivered content to a wider audience, and is very much alive
today: music video.

{% include youtube-figure id="sc9OjL6Mjqo" description="Holly Herndon & Jlin (feat. Spawn): Godmother (2019)" %}


What is compelling in music video, as Carol Vernallis puts it, is
the remediation of visual material by combining, juxtaposing, or
appropriating imagery from different sources in a manner similar to
how poetry relies on figurative language {% include cite
ref="vernallis" %}. Mathias Bonde Korgsgaard wrote that music videos
"both 'visualize music' and 'musicalize vision'" {% include cite
ref="korgsgaard" %} which is a type of symbiotic relationship
between music and video. Furthermore, Michel Chion wrote that
music’s power to displace time and space is taken a step further in
music video, where only sporadic sync points are necessary to keep
the audiovisual medium together, but the image is allowed to “wander
at will through time and space” {% include cite ref="chion"
page="82" %}. This sense of autonomous audiovisual layers that come
together at necessary sync points is different from what visual
music proposed. Instead of near-continuous audiovisual
correspondence, the music and the moving image act as
quasi-independent entities here. Their relationship is different
from one music video to another depending on the visual content,
which can be generally assigned to one of three main categories:

1) videos that portray the music performance itself;

{% include youtube-figure id="3yDP9MKVhZc" description="FKA Twigs: Two Weeks (2014)" %}

2) videos that present an independent narrative from the music; 

{% include youtube-figure id="GlhV-OKHecI" description="Squarepusher: Terminal Slam (2020)" %}

3) videos that exhibit a specific concept (such as dance, travel, abstract imagery, etc.).

{% include youtube-figure id="WF34N4gJAKE" description="Bonobo: Cirrus (2013)" %}

While visual music, video art, and music video have had different
aesthetic, cultural, and socio-economic starting points and
features, there are many overlaps in terms of how they treat music
and moving image as partners in a joint artistic endeavor. In the
following part of the unit we will look at a few theoretical
frameworks that provide insights into how sounds and images work
together in these art forms and other audiovisual manifestations.

{% include youtube-figure id="tIWhpI_unCo" description="Björk: Losss (2017)" %}

# Theoretical Frameworks

## Parallelism and Counterpoint

Sergei Eisenstein, pioneering director and film theorist, proposed
that sound montage be developed along the lines of visual montage
and that the two be asynchronous to one another. In the *Statement
on Sound* {% include cite ref="eisensteinetal" %}, Eisenstein
together with Vsevolod Pudovkin and Grigori Alexandrov postulated
that sound works either in parallel with or in counterpoint to the
visuals. By *parallel* they meant that the sound is essentially
voicing what the image is showing. This is crucial for dialogue and
sound effects going along with the image in precise sync, but not
desirable for music as it would be an aesthetic doubling. In
*counterpoint* there is a fruitful disjunction between what is seen
and what is heard. We know from music that counterpoint is the
independence of musical voices or lines that nevertheless still make
sense together. However, while in music there are three different
types of motion (parallel, contrary, and oblique), in film music
only the ‘contrary motion’ is considered to be *counterpoint* to the
image. Thus, we should note that ‘parallel vs. counterpoint’ is not
the same thing as ‘congruent vs. incongruent’, because parallel is
seen as negative, while counterpoint is the
ideal. Congruent/incongruent may be used to describe both
parallelism and counterpoint separately.
 
Michel Chion is dissatisfied with the notion of audiovisual
counterpoint and prefers to call it *audiovisual dissonance*. He
finds that, beyond the issue of quasi-misappropriation of the
musical term ‘counterpoint’, the problem is that in film sounds are
considered based on their stereotyped meaning rather than intrinsic
sonic qualities: "So the problem of counterpoint-as-contradiction,
or rather of audiovisual dissonance, [...] is that counterpoint or
dissonance implies a prereading of the relation between sound and
image." {% include cite ref="chion" page="38" %} He exemplifies this
with Jean Luc Godard’s *First Name: Carmen* that opens with a Paris
metro shot and sound of seagull cries; he calls on the fact that
critics interpreted this as counterpoint (urban setting
vs. seashore), when in fact the sound itself, stripped from its
meaning, may not have created an opposition to the image (p. 38).
 
Let us examine two examples of audiovisual performances that fit these two paradigms.

{% include end-figure %}

## Added Value & Synchresis

Michel Chion’s theories of sound-image relationships primarily
address the world of film, but they are so well thought out and
generalizable that they can easily be applied to other genres. And,
indeed, Chion is very often cited by other researchers working
toward audiovisual theories. Although many of his theoretical points
are worth considering, I mention here because of lack of space only
two aspects of sound/image relationship from his book *Audio-vision:
Sound on Screen* {% include cite ref="chion" %}.
 
The first chapter, *The Audiovisual Contract*, is based on the
audiovisual illusion Chion calls added value: “Sound shows us the
image differently than what the image shows alone, and the image
likewise makes us hear sound differently than if the sound were
ringing out in the dark” {% include cite ref="chion" page="21"
%}. The concept posited by Chion is that when combined the effect of
the two elements together (sound and image) is more powerful and
expressive than either could be presenting on its own. Key to
understanding Chion’s argument is his theory of reciprocity between
sound and image. One cannot act upon the other without being changed
itself. Thus, sound in film reaches its full potential only through
the lens of *added value*.
  
Another major concept from this book is that of *synchresis*. Chion
coined this concept in reference to the “spontaneous and
irresistible weld produced between a particular auditory phenomenon
and visual phenomenon when they occur at the same time” (p. 63). He
explains that synchresis occurs “independently of any rational
logic”—as a law of audiovisual Gestalt—but he also calls it
Pavlovian, because it is conditioned by the creator of the
synchronized event. Furthermore, the theorist underlines that
synchresis is not necessarily always rhythmic in nature, but it can
also rely on meaning, which is dependent on “cultural habits”
(p. 64). To understand this, let us consider the correspondence to
the natural world: for example, we see a balloon popping and hear
its effect as a simultaneous event. This is, in essence, an illusion
since our eyes and ears receive the stimuli asynchronously due to
the difference between the speeds of light and sound; then, the
brain also processes them at different speeds; but the brain binds
the two occurrences into one experience thanks to a process known as
[temporal
recalibration](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-02087-0).
However, unlike the natural world, the audiovisual artist has the
liberty to misplace or associate sounds and images. And, since our
brains are used to merge aural and visual events, they make sense
through synchresis. Obviously, in an artwork this relies in part on
our suspension of disbelief because we realize that the amalgamation
of dissimilar sounds and images is an artistic construct.

## Metaphor-Based Models of Multimedia

In *Analysing Musical Multimedia* {% include cite ref="cook" %},
Nicholas Cook looks at multimedia as cooperation between
semantically charged communication channels, underlining the role of
music in audiovisual meaning-making. He proposes an analysis
framework for cross-modal relationships based on correspondences
between the media, or what he calls instances of
multimedia. Considering each medium’s meaning in relation to another
and arguing that a new meaning arises when layers work
together—emergent meaning—Cook defines three metaphor-based models
of multimedia.

{% include img-figure url="./models_of_multimedia.png" %}

To reach one of these three relationships one has to put the media,
which in our case are the audiovisual layers, to a test. First is
the similarity test: are the meanings of the music and the visuals
consistent? If yes, then they exhibit *conformance*. If not, they are
still coherent since they are presented together, so another test
for difference is required: are the meanings contrary or
contradictory? This results in the *complementation* and contest
models.

*Conformance*
{% include youtube-figure id="tvZ1oZea7C8" description="Granular Synthesis: Modell 5 (1994-1996)" %}

*Complementation*

*Contest*
{% include youtube-figure id="uvDzaQOSZ3E" description="Oneohtrix Point Never: Problem Areas (2013)" %}

## Audiovisual Space

As a last theoretical point, I turn to Andrew Knight-Hill’s concept
of audiovisual space. He argues that audiovisual theories based on
temporal links cannot fully explain the richness of an audiovisual
experience. In his article *Audiovisual space: Spatiality,
experience and potentiality in audiovisual composition* {% include
cite ref="knighthill" %}, he proposes a reconceptualization of
sound-image relationships as “complementary dimensions of a unified
audiovisual space” (p. 49). He talks about a perceptual
space—not panoramic space as in surround sound—which is a ‘virtual’
space constructed in the audience member’s mind and which replaces
our normal visual field—a phenomenological space. The immersion in
the audiovisual space of the work occurs, similar to cinema, through
transcending the physical space and entering the space of the
experience. His argument thus relies on spatial concepts and
metaphors. Knight-Hill suggests that temporal constructs may be
viewed rather as changes in space through movement—in either texture
or gesture—and that expression can be found within trajectories
constructed by spatial transitions. Gesture is then an externalized
trajectory while texture is an internalized flux, both being
dispositions of energy in space.
 
“Audiovisual space is constructed through the articulation of sound
and image materials, a dynamic flux of energies unfolding through
time. The ‘reality’ of perceived space is a result of these
materials and their articulation” (p. 59).
  
The reason for bringing this paradigm to the table is that I
appreciate Knight-Hill’s attempt to move beyond the analysis of
separate consequent points in time and to consider overarching
structures that form these audiovisual spaces. I believe that,
within those spaces, the dimension of time is not eradicated and we
can still apply the previous temporal analysis tools in parallel or
in addition to the idea of a common perceptual space.

# Video-Music-Performance

## Argument

This is the point where I pivot and stop referring to the umbrella
term *audiovisual performance*. Instead I propose a new term to
designate a subgenre based on the practices that I have observed in
works by living composers who implement video in music
performance. In my own composition, I have devoted the past thirteen
years to creating and investigating audiovisual relationships in
what I call *video-music-performance*.
 
What I find powerful about the term *audiovisual performance* is
precisely what also makes it problematic in my view: its general
applicability. It encompasses too many different types of genres,
technologies, practices, and contexts. It includes VJ culture,
interactive visuals and electronic or electroacoustic music, light
shows, laser shows, projection mapping with music performances,
silent films with live music, etc. Essentially, any performance that
includes sounds and visuals, live or recorded, can be referred to as
*audiovisual performance*—whether it’s an artistic endeavor or
not. For example, a TED presentation could be called an audiovisual
performance since it includes audio (speech, maybe even music),
visuals (slides, video), and it is a performed script.
 
In analyzing other composers’ works with video, I started noticing
common threads between them, and also with my own work. So, in the
following, I will expose my proposal for delineating this subgenre
of *video-music-performance*. Because I will mention this term very
often in the rest of the unit, I will abbreviate it as VMP. As one
can notice, I decided to simply prepend the word video to the
already established discipline of *music performance* in order to show
the integration of this medium into the traditions, conventions, and
practices of music performance.
  
Going forward, I want to underline two aspects of the digital age
which I claim have had an impact on many living composers, as we
will see today in examples of VMP. First, the supremacy of the
visual culture and the increasing ease of capturing and
disseminating videos today is reflected in the growing interest of
composers to adopt and adapt moving images in their work. This is
what prompted my research into this multimedia subgenre. Second,
more and more elements from cyberculture are making their way into
compositional practices—as they have done in other art forms for the
past few decades, notably the visual arts and theatre—and they not
only influence the aesthetics and methods for structuring sounds but
also appear as distinct visual elements. Just as Alexander Schubert
thoroughly presented in the unit *History: Postdigital*, the ‘digital’
has permeated every aspect of our lives and our cultures.

## Delineating the Field

I assert that video-music-performance lives at the intersection of
music performance, composed theatre, film and visual music, video
art, and music video. And it inherits elements from all these art
forms in various degrees.

{% include img-figure url="./vmp_diagram.jpg" 
description="Video-Music-Performance and other audiovisual genres" %}

As a subgenre of audiovisual performance, VMP continues the lineage
of practices that combine sounds and image. Hence, it is preceded
and informed by over a century of similar endeavors as we have seen
earlier: color organs, avant-garde experiments of abstract
filmmakers in the first half of the 20th century, the revolutionary
video artists of the 1960s and 1970s, computerized visual music,
Internet art and digitality. But its main distinctions from other
audiovisual art forms are the centrality of live performance and the
influence of, as well as overlap with the field of new music.

When composers work with video in performance they most often bring
their musical background into the process as the primary way of
structuring audiovisual relationships, as well as relationships
between performers and electronic media. The way I look at these
structural elements is through a concept I call *symbiotic
interrelation*. This refers to the interactions that occur as a
consequence of the performers, the electronic medium of video, and
acoustic/electronic music inhabiting the same time and space of a
performance. As we know from biology, different types of organisms
can live together in a close and usually long-term interaction
called symbiosis that is mutually beneficial. This partnership
between performers, video, and music should be understood and
analyzed in the context of a specific work and its overall concept
and structure.

{% include img-figure url="./vmp_interrelations.png" 
description="Interrelations between video, music, and performer" %}

Thus, the main convention I set for demarcating this genre is that
the interconnections between music, video, and performer should be
observable in the following stages of a work:

1. conception (composer/artist/creator/initiator),
2. presentation (performer/improviser/co-creator), and
3. reception (audience member). 

I would like to give a few counterexamples that should clarify what I mean by this.

An old opera—let us take Mozart as an example—paired with novel
video projections lacks the conceptual integration of the layers at
the moment of *conception*. The interrelations that emerge between the
music and the video projections, for instance, were most likely not
considered by the composer at the time of creation. And, while also
not coincidental—since some other artist has designed them in
response to the music—I see the added projections as something
closer to a music video that is created after the music is already
completed. For this reason, I consider works that have not been
created with both sonic and visual layers from the beginning to be
outside of the scope of VMP.

{% include youtube-figure id="lS8m-ulLOK8" description="W. A. Mozart: The Magic Flute (produced by Komische Oper Berlin in cooperation with Minnesota Opera)" %}

During real time *presentation* on stage together with human
performers, video—whether preproduced or live—showcases what Paul
Sanden calls *temporal liveness* and *spatial liveness* {% include
cite ref="sanden" %} and becomes a living part of the
performance. As long as performers are aware of their relationship
to the video and to the music, this condition is met.
 
For the final stage of *reception*, if one of the layers of the
triumvirate (video <-> music <-> performer) is not visible or
audible, then I consider that work not to be a VMP. For example, a
composition that is based on a video score which the audience cannot
see falls out of this genre because of the absence of
performer-video relationships in the spectator’s perception. Notice
in the following case two different performances of the same piece:
one with the video score shown only to the performers, and the other
one displaying the video score to the audience. Therefore, the
former is not a VMP, while the latter is.
 
{% include begin-figure description="Celeste Oram: XEROX ROCK (2015)" %}
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/129306394?h=fddd3d0405&color=ff0179&portrait=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
{% include end-figure %}
{% include youtube-figure id="dSpJOVw-BFE" description="Celeste Oram: XEROX ROCK (2015)" %}
 
Furthermore, even if all three elements are there, it does not
necessarily mean that a work engages these entities in sufficient
meaningful relationships to stay within the border of the VMP
subgenre. Let us take for example an audiovisual performance by
Ryoji Ikeda.
 
{% include youtube-figure id="k3J4d4RbeWc" description="Ryoji Ikeda: Data.Matrix (2005)" %}
 
Here we are missing something that Caleb Stuart describes in the
Contemporary Music Review as "the body of the musician
. . . directly and causally in a one-to-one relationship, acting on
an object physically to create a sound" {% include cite ref="stuart"
%}. Or, in other words, there is a lack of embodied
virtuosity. Also, a conceptual connection between the body of the
performer and the visuals is not apparent. I make this distinction
precisely to avoid the overlap with many audiovisual performance
manifestations where the performer’s presence on stage is somewhat
redundant (apart of course from generating live audiovisual
material). By this I mean that we may just as well experience the
work as a recording without the live performer on stage and the
meaning of the work would not change radically. This is by no means
a value judgment, but this kind of work can properly be referred to
as *audiovisual performance*. In VMP, a work exhibits elements of
composition, structure, and/or conceptual underpinnings that relate
the performers’ bodies and/or personas to the audiovisual media so
there is a perceived spatial/temporal and/or metaphorical
interrelation between them.
 
For the rest of the unit, I will focus on the implementation of
video in relation to music and performers, because we have already
covered a fairly decent amount of music-video (sound-image)
relationships in this unit, and music-performer is an area
extensively examined in musicology.

## The Screen

The embodiment of video on stage occurs usually through one or more
screens. Whether it is an old CRT television set, a modern
large-screen display (LCD, LED, OLED, etc.), a small-screen display
such as that of a tablet or smartphone, a projection screen or a
projection surface, even a VR headset, or a non-standard display,
video becomes visible to the audience through a technologically
mediated 2D or 3D frame. Lev Manovich {% include cite ref="manovich"
%} provides a useful definition of the screen: "The visual culture
of the modern period, from painting to cinema, is characterized by
an intriguing phenomenon—the existence of *another* virtual space,
another three-dimensional world enclosed by a frame and situated
inside our normal space. The frame separates two absolutely
different spaces that somehow coexist" (p. 95).

Thus, the frame of the screen hosts a virtual world on the stage
along with the music performers. I want to propose three ways of
describing the presence, integration, and significance of a video
screen on stage. Each of them alters the perception of the music
performers in different ways. It is common for two or all three
meanings of the screen to be present in a piece. My categorization
is based on what Vivian Sobchack described as the "three metaphors
[that] have dominated film theory: the *picture frame*, the
*window*, and the *mirror*" {% include cite ref="sobchack" page="14"
%}. The picture frame refers to formalist theories that consider the
frame a synthetic space and insist on the artificial elements of
cinema, such as ‘montage’ (editing). In contrast, the *window*
metaphor is linked to realist theories which advocate an honest
representation of reality. The screen as a *mirror* signifies the
spectator's identification not only with characters in the film but
also with the apparatus of cinema (camera, projector, screen), which
ultimately leads to identification with the self {% include cite
ref="metz" %}. My usage of these terms in the following
categorization does not attempt to retain the strict original sense
of the metaphors, but rather adjusts them as necessary for the
practices of VMP.

**Screen as picture frame** can (re)contextualize the music
performance.  The video displayed on screen provides clarification
or adds external meanings to the music performance.

{% include begin-figure description="David Bithell and Terry
Longshore: penumbra (2014)" %}
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/96259853?h=167d9564bb" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
{% include end-figure %}

**Screen as window** can virtually augment the stage and the
performance.  The stage and performers are connected to other
worlds, possibly inhabited by other performers.

{% include youtube-figure id="Gcpzf6BfQ3w" description="Michel van der Aa: Sunken Garden (2011-2012) " %}

 
**Screen as mirror** can reflect the performers on stage.  Among the
works I have encountered, the most widespread and effective solution
for video integration is the reflection—literal or figurative—of
music performance or any aspect of it onto the screen. This metaphor
of the mirror is so prevalent in VMP that it deserves special
attention. There are in fact so many pieces with mirrored performers
that I am almost tempted to suggest a sub-subgenre of VMP: perhaps
it could be called *meta-video-music-performance*. But, for now, I
will attempt a classification of *screen reflections* that I found in
VMP works.
 
To aid my taxonomy, I turn to French philosopher Jean Baudrillard
and his book *Simulations and Simulacra* {% include cite
ref="baudrillard" %}, in which he examines relationships between
reality, symbols, and society, claiming that our current society has
replaced all reality and meaning with symbols and signs, and that
human experience is a simulation of reality. However, I have to
admit this is going to be, again, a very speculative
approach. Baudrillard distinguishes four levels of an image as
simulation of reality and, for the purpose of looking at the screen
as a mirror on stage in VMP, I make the following proposition based
on Baudrillard’s four stages of the image.

1) *“it is the reflection of a profound reality”*

1a) for example, a photograph
    
{% include img-figure url="https://dpanoply.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/natural-light-baby-portrait-editing-lightroom-workflow/final.jpg"

2) *“it masks and denatures a profound reality”*

2a) The image on the right in figure {{ baby-photo-fig }} could be a photograph that has been manipulated digitally

2b) in audio, a recording of an instrument may be edited/enhanced

2c) in VMP: **doppelgängers** (unfaithful copies)

{% include end-figure %}

{% include youtube-figure id="wBJgP5oEIfQ" description="Brigitta Muntendorf: Public Privacy #1 Flute Cover (2013)" %}

3) *“it masks the absence of a profound reality”*

3a) an example may be a photograph that has been created digitally to simulate reality—hyperreality;

3c) in VMP: **avatars** (virtual representations)

{% include end-figure %}

4) *“it has no relation to any reality whatsoever; it is its own pure simulacrum"*

4a) a digital image that has no correspondence in nature could fit in this category

4b) similarly, a recording of a synthesizer that does not sound like any known acoustic instrument would match this category

Now that I have established the integration of video's ‘body’ (the
screen) on stage relative to the performers, I want to return to the
diagram of interrelations and define a few categories that describe
their interaction.

## Interrelations between Video and Performer(s)

The two main categories of interrelations between the three entities
in VMP refer to **direct** connections, when the three layers are
intrinsically engaged with each other, and **indirect** connections that
exist on an implicit level, when the layers seem to be connected but
their associations are forged.

The issue of *live* vs *fixed* (prerecorded) video is also at stake here since a live video may appear more direct than a fixed one, although a meaningful performer-video link can be established with both types of material. Preproduced video seems to prevent any true interaction with the performers on stage, especially from the performer's perspective. However, this is perhaps one of the most interesting areas, in my opinion, to be explored by composers working with video: creating artificial but meaningful interrelations between the living organism of human performer and the fixed medium of video. 

{% include img-figure url="./vmp_connections.jpg" description="Examples of direct and
indirect connections between video, music, and performer." %}
    
Let us turn our attention, again, to the relationship between
performer and video.

### Direct connections

As direct connections, we can observe **reactive** and **interactive**
elements. Because real interactivity between performer and video
requires a process of mutual influence, I have noticed that it
occurs less frequently in this strict sense in VMP. Instead, we as
audience experience either some type of *reactivity* between musician
and video or a *fabricated interactivity* crafted by the composer and
enacted by the performer and the video.

a) Reactive connections

The video is created directly by the performer in real time:

description="Constantin Basica: Chord Optimization in Music Composition: Towards a Machine-Inspired Technique for Human-Based Performance (2018)" %}

As an example of the reverse situation, the performer is influenced by the video:

b) Interactive connections

### Indirect connections 

I classify these as illusory or metaphorical connections. 

a) Illusory connections

Here the attempt is to convince the audience of a link between
performer and video, either through the video itself or through the
music.

b) Metaphorical connections

By *metaphorical* I refer to the associations between video and
performer on a symbolic level. In this case, it is not an attempt to
trick the audience’s perception but rather to invite them to
discover deeper meanings.

## Video-Music-Performance Off-Stage

As we get to the end of this unit, I want to pose a question in
relation to the context of our current pandemic (at the time of
writing): what happens when VMP cannot take place on a stage in
front of an audience anymore?
 
Many musicians have fled to online performance formats in the past
year while on lockdowns. The screen then swallows the entire visual
aspect of the performance and the music is fully mediatized. How
about the *liveness*? This year we have seen prerecorded and live
streamed performances from artists’ homes, as well as documentation
of performances or livestreams with artists physically present in
empty venues as the audience tunes in from home. How does this alter
the interrelations between video, music, and performers? In some
ways, not much. If a performance is simply attempting to replicate
what would have taken place on a stage in front of an audience, then
it is possible to transport most of it from the *frame* of the stage
to the frame of the screen (and from the acoustic space to the one
reproduced by speakers/headphones). However, during this year of
lockdowns, composers and performers have experimented with the
idiosyncrasies of the online medium, while also staying close to
traditional notions of physical performance. One important
peculiarity of *virtual VMP* is that live performers are already
virtual, so the immersive merging with other prerecorded virtual
performers and digital entities becomes possible.

## Why Video-Music-Performance?

A few conclusory thoughts about this proposed subgenre of video-music-performance and what it means for the three parties involved: composer, performer, and audience member. 
 
For composers:
* There is a revived interest and tendency toward extra-musical
  elements.
* Experimentations in this field allow any combination, alteration,
  or negation of the inherited conventions from other related
  audiovisual genres, without displaying an intent to revolutionize
  but rather to create anew.
* Although the musical score is still central most of the time,
  audio and video channels offer composers ways of circumventing the
  need for notation, which can be enhanced or substituted by sonic
  and/or visual cues.
* Through techniques of customizing VMP works with preproduced or
  live video of the performers, composers find new ways of engaging
  with the musicians, accepting their impact in the work as
  collaborators.
  
For performers:
* VMP is also a gain for performers as they may become co-creators
  of the work by providing musical or visual input; so in a way this
  is an emancipation from the conventional role of the performer as
  solely an interpreter of the score.
* Performers' corporeal presence on stage is often enhanced through
  the reflection of themselves in video or association with elements
  of the video.
* As a consequence of their relationship to the video, the practices
  and traditions of music performance can be invoked and reassessed,
  or ignored and replaced, for example, by more theatrical
  practices.
   
For audience members:
* The audience members are still often passive observers (at least
  in terms of being involved in the performance), but they are
  engaged in a keen intermodal immersion that triggers not only
  their knowledge of music, but also of film, theatre, popular
  culture, and so on.
* There is an opportunity to understand and experience musical
  relationships and performance elements from a visual perspective
  through the use of video; Michael Beil said video helps him “lead
  the attention of the audience to special parts of the musical
  performance”. So the audience can see connections between musical
  materials in time.
    
On a final note, I believe that the act of incorporating video in
traditional music performance is part of postmodern, and more
recently metamodern tendencies toward extra-musical
elements. Metamodernism is a proposed movement that synthesizes key
cultural, aesthetic, and philosophic elements from modernism and
postmodernism, being simultaneous with the postdigital,
postindustrial, global age. In short, it is a constant oscillation
between opposing states, for example, being both sincere and ironic
or naive and cynical. Meta here is used for its Platonian meaning of
metaxis (in-between). In most of the examples of VMP I gave, the
contextualization of music material through the presence of the
video elements is not a cynical approach to creating new music but
rather a natural extension of the artistic needs of composers. Thus,
these audiovisual practices relate to the metamodernist spirit
because they do not attempt to subvert traditional modes of
performing music on stage. Instead, the use of video is generally
reverential to music performance and its conventions. Even in cases
when video seems to threaten the significance of the performers
because of its dominance or inflexible nature, humans remain vital
for the dissemination of live music.
     
This type of work proposes special ways of composing, performing,
and experiencing music that invite techniques and meanings from
outside of the musical world, aligning it with other multimedia
genres. I would like to end with a quote from Gene Youngblood's
seminal book Expanded Cinema {% include cite ref="youngblood" %},
which sums up my intention to persevere in creative and academic
investigations of the video-music-performance subgenre: "One can no
longer specialize in a single discipline and hope truthfully to
express a clear picture of its relationships in the environment"
(p. 41).
