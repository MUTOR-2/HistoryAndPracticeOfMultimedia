   subtitle: Dance and New Technologies - an Overview of Developments in the 20th CenturyDance and New Technologies - an Overview of Developments in the 20th Century
   subabstract: Since the beginning of the 20th century, choreographers and dancers in their artistic works have been seeking to engage with the new (media) technologies of their time. At the same time, these developments have repeatedly triggered controversial discussions about the role of the body in dance and in the technological context. In her lecture, Kerstin Evert will use choreographic works and examples of important choreographers such as Merce Cunningham or William Forsythe to give an overview of the essential themes, discourses and developments in dance in the 20th century, whose basic choreographic-technological ideas already refer to artistic approaches and projects currently taking place.
