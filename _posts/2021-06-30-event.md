   bio: >
     Teoma Naccarato and John MacCallum have been collaborating 
     since they met in 2013. Their collective work draws on their 
     backgrounds in music composition, choreography, computer science, 
     and creative writing, as well as their deep interest in 
     performance art and philosophy. Together they have created 
     numerous video and performance works which take as their 
     starting point the materiality and temporality of the heart. 
     With the use of stethoscopes and electrocardiograms they 
     enliven sonic and haptic installations, and generate variable 
     metronomes to introduce calculated unpredictability into the 
     unfolding of live events. In addition to sensing the heart by 
     way of technology, many of their performances and videos 
     incorporate a dissected heart. Held between them, the flesh 
     of the heart shapes the context of their shared touch, breath, 
     and interaction, and invites questions related to mediation 
     and representation of bodies in performance.</br></br>
     
     Recent performance works include III: Once Removed, 
     III: Tangente, Synchronism, and Portraits, presented at venues 
     in Toronto, Montreal, San Francisco, Phoenix, London, Hamburg, 
     and Berlin.  In addition, they have been awarded artist 
     residencies at research centres such as IRCAM (Paris), 
     Djerassi (California), CLOUD/Danslab (The Hague) and 
     Lake Studios (Berlin). Since 2016 they have published a series 
     of articles together in journals focussed on dance and somatics, 
     music and composition, movement and computing, and 
     performance philosophy, reflecting the trans-disciplinary 
     breadth of their artistic and scholarly interests.</br></br>
     
     Teoma holds a PhD from the Centre for Dance Research (C-DaRE) at 
     Coventry University in the UK, and did her MFA at the Ohio 
     State University, and her BFA at Concordia University in 
     Montreal, all in dance/choreography. John did his PhD at 
     UC Berkeley, his MM at McGill University in Montreal, 
     and his BM at the University of the Pacific in California, 
     all in music composition. They have each held a variety of 
     research and teaching positions over the years in the US and 
     Europe, and currently live in Berlin with their cat. </br></br>

abstract: >
  In this talk composer John MacCallum and choreographer Teoma Naccarato 
  interweave questions related to politics, identity, and representation 
  in multimedia performance. The basic premise of the 
  talk is that representation does not exist, and yet illusions of 
  causality and interaction between bodies, movement, and media 
  persist and have very real effects in the world, thus warranting 
  deep consideration on an aesthetic and ethical level. 
  Drawing on feminist and process philosophies, they probe shifting 
  distributions of agency and intelligibility within and between 
  differentiated "things" â€“ gestures, sounds, bodies, identities, 
  disciplines. Moving fluidly between examples from dance, music, 
  interaction design, machine learning and artificial intelligence, 
  they foreground concerns related to inscribed bias and systemic 
  inequality in the design and use of technologies in art and life, 
  as well as the ways in which mediums of representation are always 
  already entangled within situated understandings of what it 
  means to be human.
