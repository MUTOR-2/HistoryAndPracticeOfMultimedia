     the Open Source Studio (OSS) project, an educational initiative
     exploring collaborative online research and teaching in the
     media arts. He also organized the Art of the Networked Practice
     Online Symposia in 2015 and 2018, global events that featured
     speakers, live performances, and participants from more than 40

abstract: >
  Over 150 years ago, the German composer Richard Wagner in his
  historic essay “Outlines of the Artwork of the Future,” defined
  the Gesamtkunstwerk (Total Artwork) as the integration of the arts
  through music drama and the community of theater. In the virtual
  realm of Wagner’s theater, he imagined the future of multimedia as
  a darkened arena for the immersive synthesis of music, poetry,
  visual effects and surround-sound reverberance.  Wagner’s
  objective was to suspend the audience’s disbelief, and to “forget
  the confines of the auditorium… which seems the wide expanse of
  the whole World.” Fast forward through the annals of media
  histories, we discover a trajectory in which artists,
  technologists, and visionary thinkers have imagined a new kind of
  Gesamtdatenwerk (Total Datawork), the totalization and synthesis
  of the arts unfolding in the cloud.  According to British theorist
  Roy Ascott, “the individual user of networks is always potentially
  involved in a global net, and the world is always potentially in a
  state of interaction with the individual.” Today more than ever,
  in the wake of the pandemic, the wide expanse of the whole world
  resides on our desktop, a stage for networked experiences we
  engage in daily, as well as those that don’t yet exist. This
  lecture/performance by Randall Packer is an invitation to venture
  together into the Deep Third Space to imagine and explore new
  multimedia potentialities and realizations of the community of
  theater in a globally connected culture.
