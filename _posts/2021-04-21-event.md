   bio: >
    Alexander Schubert (1979) studied bioinformatics, multimedia 
    composition. He's a professor at the Musikhochschule Hamburg.
    Schubert's interest explores the border between the acoustic 
    and electronic world. In music composition, immersive 
    installation and staged pieces he examines the interplay between 
    the digital and the analogue. He creates pieces that realize 
    test settings or interaction spaces that question modes of 
    perception and representation. Continuing topics in this field 
    are authenticity and virtuality. The influence and framing 
    of digital media on aesthetic views and communication is 
    researched in a post-digital perspective. Recent research 
    topics in his works were virtual reality, artificial 
    intelligence and online-mediated artworks. Schubert is a 
    founding member of ensembles such as 'Decoder'.

abstract: >
 In the context of postdigitality, artistic practices can be 
 understood as tools for making digital influences visible. 
 This approach is based on the assumption that today the use of 
 digital tools and forms of representation is no longer the 
 exception but the rule, and that our interactions, ways of seeing, 
 and images of the body are now significantly shaped by this 
 circumstance. In particular, these approaches explore the question 
 of whether, in this newly established condition, our view of the 
 analog, non-digitally mediated environment has also changed. 
 Post-digitality can be understood as a shift in perception. This 
 readjustment of a viewpoint that is digitally influenced or 
 reflective of the digital will be presented as a compositional 
 strategy. This practice can be considered as a technique that 
 actively thematizes the interpenetration of the analog by the 
 digital and their interplay, thus making it possible to experience. 
 The reconciliation of virtual and physical worlds and their 
 artistic decoupling will be presented as a compositional approach 
 and method of artistic research that attempts not only to convey 
 these implications theoretically, but also to make them 
 comprehensible to the senses.
