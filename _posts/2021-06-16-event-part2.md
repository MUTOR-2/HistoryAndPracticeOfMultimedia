   subtitle: Sound as things in space&#58 Some thoughts on 3D Audio 
   subabstract: We imagine sound as things, as bounded and tangible physical objects in space. „3D“ is the way we perceive sound. And spatial language as a manifestation of spatial cognition is not just common in the description of spatial position and movement, but also in the description of pitch, timbre and intensity&#58 A sound can be big or small, it can be edgy, sharp, flat or round, a tone can be high or low, a melody rising or falling. Can a listener distinguish between these metaphorical and physical properties of a sound? And how are spatial positions and trajectories of sound, spatial cognition and emotional impact related? The intedependencies between physical and metaphorical space become specifically interesting in „3D“ audio systems like VR audio, Ambisonics or multichannel sound, where position and movement in space become creative devices.
   bio: Thomas Görne was Professor of Theory of Music Transmission at Erich Thienhaus Institute (Tonmeister institute) of Hochschule für Musik Detmold 2004-2008. Since 2008 he is Professor of Audio Design and Audio Systems and head of the Sound Lab / Immersive Audio Lab at Hamburg University of Applied Sciences (HAW Hamburg). His main interests are virtual auditory spaces and the emotional impact of sound.
