    Georg Hajdu grew up in Cologne where he obtained diplomas in
    molecular biology and musical composition from the University of
    Cologne and the Cologne University of Music and Dance.  A
    stipend by the German Academic Exchange Service enabled him to
    enter the graduate program in composition at the University of
    California, Berkeley in 1990, working closely with the Center
    for New Music and Audio Technologies (CNMAT) and eventually
    obtaining a Ph.D. in 1994. </br> 
    In 1996, following residencies
    at IRCAM and the ZKM, Karlsruhe, he co-founded the ensemble
    WireWorks, a group specializing in the performance of
    electro-acoustic music. In 1999, he produced his full-length
    opera "Der Sprung â€“ Beschreibung einer Oper" for which renowned
    author and filmmaker Thomas Brasch wrote the libretto.  In May
    2002, his Internet performance environment Quintet.net was
    employed in a Munich Biennale opera production (Orpheus Kristall
    by Manfred Stahnke), and in the same year Georg Hajdu became
    professor of multimedia composition at the Hamburg University of
    Music and Drama (HfMT). There, in 2004, he established Germany's
    first master's program in multimedia composition and, in 2012,
    the Center for Microtonal Music and Multimedia (ZM4). He was
    also involved in a number of large international projects such
    as CO-ME-DI-A, a European Culture 2007 project focussing on
    Networked Music Performance. </br> 
    Hajdu has published
    compositions which are characterized by a pluralistic attitude
    and have earned him several international prizes, the IBM-prize
    of the Ensemble Modern among them. He is also the author of
    numerous articles on topics on the borderline of music,
    technology and science as well as software applications such
    MaxScore (with Nick Didkovsky), Quintet.net, DJster and a
    real-time version of Stockhausen's Elektronische Studie II.

abstract: >
 While the groundwork for computer music and multimedia as we 
 practice it today had been laid during the first part of the 
 20th century, the development of the digital computer during the 
 middle of the previous century was a catalyst of gargantuan 
 impact. Yet the beginnings of digital art were modest as artists 
 had a vision but didn't really know how to teach a computer to 
 accomplish what they were after. The post-war "tabula rasa" 
 period in Europe and the United States was one of 
 experimentation and speculation not just in digital art and much 
 of what was produced was informed by the budding fields of 
 information and communication theory. Yet in 1965 John R. 
 Pierce expressed his frustration with the digital computer:
 "As a musical instrument, the computer has unlimited 
 potentialities for uttering sound. It can, in fact, produce 
 strings of numbers representing any conceivable or hearable 
 sound... Wonderful things would come out of that box if only 
 we knew how to evoke them." This chimed in a new phase in the 
 exploration of the digital computer for art making. In the 
 early 1970s, the first computer music centers were established 
 as platforms for interdisciplinary research where composers, 
 engineers, scholars and scientists were invited to collaborate. 
 With personal computers being slow and costly, those centers 
 remained major attractors for the technically minded composers 
 and the artistically minded technologists, until the advent of 
 broadband Internet and the development of cheap and 
 extraordinarily efficient CPUs led to a paradigm shift around 
 the turn of the millennium. The systematic exploration of the 
 affordances of the computer gave way to a more intuitive and 
 interactive manipulation of digital interfaces both for the 
 acquisition of knowledge and the production of art. 
 The postdigital era was born.
