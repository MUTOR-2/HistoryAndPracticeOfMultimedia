abstract: >
  The unification of music and visual arts has been attempted
  throughout history, with opera being one instance. In the 20th
  Century, sounds and moving images have been syncretized in various
  art forms, such as film or video art, as well as in popular
  culture (television, music video, the Internet, etc.). Today, with
  rapid technological advancement and accessible hardware/software
  tools, artists employ both sonic and visual elements in their
  performance practice. What are the interrelations between music,
  video, and performers? Briefly touching on historical examples
  from the lineage of audiovisual genres, we will look at various
  theoretical frameworks and practices of engaging audiovisual media
  in the context of stage performance, with a focus on the scene of
  new music. Following the recent increase of works by composers who
  fuse video with music performance in similar ways, there is a need
  to delineate a new subgenre of multimedia, which will be proposed
  in this lecture.
