   bio: >
    Growing up as multi-instrumentalist, Jacob Sello (1976) played
    in various ensembles and bands of different musical styles. For
    20 years he focuses on electronic music production, composition
    of interactive stage performances and sound installation art. He
    studied audio engineering (SAE Hamburg), multimedia composition
    (HfMT Hamburg, M.A.) and systematic musicology (Hamburg
    University) where he received a PhD for his research on the
    perception of sound art.
    
    He loves exploring the vast potential of interactivity arising
    from the conjunction of trained musicians, traditional
    instruments and experimental sensor-technology - resulting in
    pieces for clarinet-driven RC-helicopters, realtime-generated
    instrumental scores extracted from dance gestures or music for a
    turntable-controlled pneumaticially prepared Disklavier. Jacob
    develops custom sensors and controllers for sound installations,
    modular synthesizers and interactive multimedia-performances. He
    is the creator of the award-winning Hexenkessel – a
    multitouch-enabled timpani, developed since 2010. His works have
    been internationally performed. Currently, Jacob Sello is
    professor at HfMT Hamburg and director of HfMT´s Innovation Lab,
    where he creates novel interfaces for interdisciplinary stage
    arts.

abstract: >
 "In the 20th century, working with sound is not the exclusive 
 domain of musicians and composers. In Sound Installation Art the 
 sonic elements turn out to be a space-consuming and sculptural 
 material of the fine arts. In contrast to traditional music 
 where time is the main concern, many sound artist focus on 
 spacial aspects more than on time-based narrativity. Their 
 “atmospheric soundscapes” often appear to be quasi-static, while 
 the visitors are by no means passive consumers as in a classical 
 concert hall: they move through the sonic environments at their 
 individual pace and become interactive protagonists of their very 
 own aesthetic experience. In sound installation art, the sounding 
 atmospheres create moods and emotions constituting feelings and 
 the subjective experience. In this introductory presentation 
 historic and technological developments relevant for the emergence 
 of interactive Sound Installations are discussed. In addition, 
 dimensions of space and aesthetic are considered."
